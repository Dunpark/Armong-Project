With its innovative and creative gameplay, sophisticated pixel art style, easy-to-understand and immersive story, great music, and just the right amount of atmosphere, this game, still in its EA stage, is just too good for its same genre.\\n\\nThe gameplay is simple and easy to understand, but also requires skill to achieve precision. The plot is not obscure, with a simple and immersive story that makes it easy for any player to understand the game's going. The excellent level of design and distinctive boss fights add to the experience. I personally found the game to be relatively easy to play, and the adjustable difficulty makes it easy for all types of gamers to get the hang of it.\\n\\nThe game is not yet completed all the development, so players will inevitably be forced to stop playing when they are in the middle of the game. There are various shortcomings in the game, including but not limited to: the lack of recognizable scene design, the small font size of the character dialogs, the linear flow of the game, and the inability to go back through levels. Overall, the game still has a lot of room for improvement and I'm looking forward to it getting better and better.\\n\\nI don't need to tell you how good SANABI is again, but since the game is not yet complete, it's a good idea for those who want to experience the full game to either buy it first or wait and see. However, since the game is still in its early access stage, you may want to wait for the full game release or support the developers by buying it now. Judging from the roadmap released by the developer, we can expect great things from SANABI, and I, for one, am excited to see the game improve and evolve.\"},\n",

This is the game for you, especially with that mix of the Cyberpunk aesthetic.\\nIF YOU LIKE THIS GAME, CHECK OUT EASTWARD. BEAUTIFUL PIXEL ART WITH EQUALLY AMAZING  STORY-LINE.\\n\\nI\\'m an incredibly avid pixel game fan, I\\'m not just speaking of classic Zelda, castlevania or Stardew. I\\'m a HUGE sucker for breathtaking pixel art visuals partnered with an amazing story.\\n\\nHonestly the only other game I can recommend that gives the same HUGE impact like this one has got to be Eastward.\\nEver since I played Eastward back in 2021, I was lost in the void constantly seeking and searching for a game that was honestly the exact same.\\n\\nBreathtaking visuals, banger music, fun mechanics, and very VERY rich storyline. But with the different amount of games (and trust me, I\\'ve searched EVERYWHERE), nothing came close to Eastward.\\n\\nUntil now.\\n\\nI, very rarely, actually sit down and bulldoze through a game, sometimes I get burnt out and \"take a break\" for a couple of days and if I end up not wanting to play as much as I first started then I have the tendency to just drop the game until further notice, sometimes never touching it ever again.\\nSo the fact this game broke through my standard protocol and I would rush home from work to immediately play and beat it in 3 days since I bought it? My goodness.\\n\\nTHAT\\'S how you KNOW it\\'s a great game.\\n\"Great\" doesn\\'t even COME CLOSE to how MAGNIFICENT this game is.\\n\\n2 years, I was searching for a game similar to one that had increases my standards in pixel gaming and was always disappointed or didn\\'t have my itch scratched, but this one will have to take the spot in my heart.\\n\\nNow I\\'ll be looking for a game that is similar to this one instead. The bar has increased and I\\'m so excited to see and play more games by Wonder Potion.\\n\\nThis game provided such an amazing adventure with so many new and amazing concepts, I can\\'t even begin to describe the PERFECT EXECUTION that this game provided. From the backstory, the hinting, to the plot twists and the end. It all pieced together so amazingly and ughhh I wish I could just forget the game and \"WIPE THE DATA\" from my memory so that I CAN EXPERIENCE IT AGAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME (sorry for my lame pun).\\n\\nAnyways, this game is  MUST PLAY, ABSOLUTELY. AND AGAIN, IF YOU LIKED THIS GAME, PLAY EASTWARD THANKS BYE.'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"Its hard for me to really describe how much fun I'm having with this game. This is definitely an action game but unlike any I have really played before. They make a Grappling Hook not only one of the most fun ways to traverse any environment but also a deadly weapon that stops enemies in their tracks as long as you are accurate enough to hit your target. This game is really ENTIRELY skill based because of its elegantly simple combat mechanic. Simple to understand but difficult and satisfying to master (at least for me on my XBox controller) \\n\\nIt has a familiar cyberpunk aesthetic but comes at the cyberpunk genre from a different perspective. You can see the normal Cyber Punk Archetypes but because the story and the world have so much character they feel fresh along with the world.\\n\\nThe music is intense and makes you feel like everything you are doing is the most important thing in the world. It compliments the moment to moment game play in a way that half the time you feel like you are a Master  one moment and the next moment scrambling to keep up with the pace. \\n\\nThis game isn't open world but every minute you are playing the game the world still feels deeper, and even though the point of the game is to explore an abandoned city the city still feels more alive then most open world games. \\n\\nAnd then there'ss the STORY, I didn't think I was going to get this into the narrative. Your main character has depth in a 2D Game just based on their actions, how they handle loss, their motives and what scares them. All while giving off this Batman Vibe. The story is a mystery that you unravel with each passing minute and there are actual moments in this where I was literally gasping with shock. The pacing of the game just keeps making you want to learn more and get better at the mechanics so you can explore more\\n\\nIn this game the story and the world are directly tied so by discovering more about the story you are effectively exploring this world. The Screenplay is top notch and understands that every character to stand out CANNOT sound/feel the same and when our characters meet others that have personalities that clash it actually pushes the story forward instead of just being a cute moment. \\n\\nThis game takes the 2D Platformer Genre and kicked down all the barriers that would make it feel flat or without depth. Cyberpunk 2077 could only hope to have the kind of seemingly effortless story telling chops this game has.\\n\\nAnd then you have the PIXEL ART. Just on another level. when I was a kid playing SNES I don't think I could have dreamed of a better Pixel Art game.\\n\\nThis game gets me excited for my steam deck\"},\n",

Solid action platformer with fluid movement, surprisingly engaging story (very much looking forward to future chapters), and some amazing art/music direction. Minimal cons, really just nitpicks. Buy this game! \\n\\nPros:\\n- Good Music \\n- Great Art \\n- Fluid Movement - some of the best of any platformer i've played \\n- Interesting (enough) Combat \\n- A story which was fine in the beginning, but really hooked me into the building story-arc by the time i reached the end - it left me wanting more in a good way. Lots to look forward to as more content is added to the game!!!\\n- 2 good bossfights \\n- inclusion of a speedrun mode is really nice, for those who want *everything* timed. and getting rid of cutscenes for future playthroughs\\n- the protagonist has real motives and, despite his somewhat limited dialogue, acts like a fairly real person. written concisely i think would be a good term \\n- the deuteragonist was a little annoying at first, but definitely grew on me\\n- there was a really really cool moment towards the end of the currently playable content, i won't spoil it but i made me jump a little lol \\n\\nCons: \\n- 1 bad bossfight. middle child is always neglected, i guess? it's not really *offensively* bad, just not nearly as good as the other two. \\n- Some of the stage gimmicks are too easy \\n- the higher difficulties don't change the game enough, they just make you health progressively lower. in retrospect i could've even put the game on the highest difficulty (where you have 1 hp) and only really struggled with a handful of platforming sections, and one of the bosses in particular\\n- there's only one save slot atm\\n- this means in order to play the timed portions of the tutorial you need to erase current progress ( a way to access these in the main menu maybe?)\\n- some of the signs and notes in cutscenes are untranslated from korean (as this is a brand new korean indie studio, i give them a lot of slack in this department, the english TL of the story is better than a lot of native-english game writing these days)\\n- some of the audio settings are too loud by default, even with my system audio being pretty quiet, and some of the audio effects are disproportionately tuned (footsteps on a steel floor in a cutscene being louder than some of the gunshots right after). not a massive deal though, only broke my immersion once at the very beginning, and after i tuned audio sliders all was well.\\n\\nOverall i'd say the majority of my Cons are nitpicks, and i purposefully kept a lot of what i *couldve* praised in the Pros concise or absent so as to not spoil some of the great fun in this game. \\n\\nVery very much looking forward to what the team at WONDER POTION do with this project next!\"},\n",

If you have ever mastered games in the past like Sonic The Hedgehog for the Genesis, you will feel a lot of satisfaction as you quickly progress through each stage section and master the simple to learn, but hard to master grappling hook mechanic.

And while I did make it through, it was harder than even Katana Zero.\\n\\nGameplay - 10/10. This game not only plays smoothly, especially when you get a hang of it, but it makes you look cool while doing so. Maybe it's my appeal towards hookshots but man oh man, was it fun. Platformers are generally not my thing, but SANABI is a whole new level that allows you to move in ways most platformers wouldn't and in an intuitive manner. Though some of the bosses (JUSTICE) were extremely difficult, the frustration never fully seeped in cause of the learning experience behind it.\\n\\nStory - 8/10 - I cannot fully evaluate the story to be fair, cause the reality is, it's not finished quite yet. But the story is entertaining. Maybe it's cause I voice acted over the characters speaking, but it brought in intensity. The characters were likable to say the least. Honestly, if they need a voice actor, I hope I can be the one who does it for the main (Unnamed?) character. (I legitimately voice acted the whole game for each character too) The game provides charm and a bit of something else to it that really brings out the environment. One thing I will state for the benefit of the developer though.\\n(THERE ARE SOME GRAMMATICAL ERRORS! I WISH I SAVED A SCREEN SHOT OF EACH ONE! I APOLOGIZE! THERE WERE ABOUT 3!)\\n\\nGraphics/Art Style - 10/10 - This one's a bit of a tricky situation. Maybe it's my appeal to pixel art, but the animations really emphasize on making the game feel what it is. As mentioned before, the game play makes you look cool, but the animations themselves are part of the reason why. From flipping into the air, to landing on a wall in specific ways. This game provides a lot and puts heart into it that I cannot deny.\\n\\nMusic - 6/10 - Maybe it's because I'm picky as a musician, but the music didn't exactly WOW me compared to everything else in the game. It wasn't bad, just not mind blowing. Though I will say this much, it did it's job well. It provided to each environment in the correct tone. Though, there was a bit to be desired from it.\\n\\nOverall - 10/10 - While I may dismiss some aspects of the game, I'm not going to just deteriorate my overall score. The game play more than satisfied what I've wanted out of a game in a long time. It provided a challenge that was fabulous and an intensity that most games don't in this day and age. A fantastic game that I cannot wait to finish in the future.\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': '(I played the full game now; I\\'m changing this review to positive and will write more details later. The rest of the message is the old review)\\n\\n-----\\n\\n(Keep in mind this review was written back in Early Access; I still need to revisit the game to give it a more fair rating and review)\\n\\nI can\\'t, with a light conscience, recommend this game as it is right now, as much as I want to.\\nKeep in mind that the game is in early access, and a lot of what I\\'ll be saying might change for the better; this is exactly why I\\'m writing this review.\\n\\nFirst, let\\'s start with the negatives:\\n(-) The cutscenes and dialogues are too frequent, and break the pacing of the game quite a lot. There are dozens of very long cutscenes, many of which don\\'t seem to be necessary.\\n(-) The dialogues have several problems; even in the intro sequence, it\\'s possible to spot moments where text boxes don\\'t seem to match the context, or dialogues don\\'t make sense, at least in English.\\n(-) The translation is incorrect or inaccurate, which adds to the dialogue being bad.\\n(-) The dialogue goes TOO FAST during action sequences. I think dialogue during action sequences is great, but having it be unreadable is just frustrating and not fun; I had to pause during my playthrough during these dialogues, when I cared about it.\\n(-) The story is intriguing, which makes this all the more frustrating; you really want to take the game seriously, but these problems make it so that it\\'s hard to.\\n(-) The game doesn\\'t really explain to you about clockwise and counter-clockwise movement with the dash. Although players will eventually figure it out, I think with the amount of tutorials, the game could have told me that as well.\\n(-) There was some untranslated Korean text in a few cutscenes. It\\'s understandable with the scenery, but I think it would do good just to have some subtitles, you know?\\n(-) Some areas seem very empty or incomplete, bland, with nothing new. I think these would be a good opportunity for the game to put some of the exceeding dialogue, instead of cramming all of it into a million cutscenes. Namely, I can see the \"plan\" sequences working out during these more empty parts.\\n(-) There were some opportunities lost with gameplay. I think this would be a perfect game to play with more momentum mechanics and bunny hopping. Making that easier and accessible for the player would be a good idea. Instead, touching the ground while attached to a hook just makes you lose all momentum. Also, retracting to your hook does not make you keep your speed when you cancel the retraction, and I think that\\'s a big lost opportunity.\\n(-) The parts with throwing the enemies into the laser just felt a lot more boring than the idea sounded like.\\n(-) There are no secrets and no real hidden easter eggs or anything like that. At least none that I could find. I feel like this game would greatly benefit from having several collectibles and hidden areas, to explore everything you can do with the tech of the hook.\\n( ? ) This might be just me, but I didn\\'t understand health and checkpoints very well. I\\'ve finished the game in about 3 hours or so, on hard mode, and had about 2 or 3 deaths; but I thought I was supposed to die after 2 hits? It semeed like I had 4 health instead, despite playing on \"hard\", where I was supposed to die in 2 hits.\\n\\nNow let\\'s talk about the good points:\\n(+) The gameplay is fluid and satisfying; it\\'s a character that is \"fun to play as\". The hook movement just works, and having a game based solely on that is a good plus.\\n(+) The artstyle is beautiful; it reminds me of Katana Zero a lot. There is even a Katana Zero reference inside the game (time samurai, lmao)\\n(+) Add this to having several animations for the characters. Characters have many different poses and expressions, and it seems like it never ends. Specially, Mari and the Daughter were really adorable during the cutscenes.\\n(+) The screen transitions feel smooth! I like that a lot in the game.\\n(+) It has a good sense of humor in the dialogue. I feel like some jokes drag on for too long, but in general, it\\'s likeable and I did laugh a few times.\\n(+) The music is good! Not phenomenal, but it was nice to listen to.\\n(+) The story is intriguing, and it did make me a bit emotional. Although the beginning is so positive and wholesome, that you know exactly what\\'s going to happen after.\\n\\n\\nOverall, this game needs little to be an amazing game, but it\\'s important to let devs know about the problems with it.\\nAs the game keeps getting updated, I\\'ll keep playing it, and I\\'ll update my review when I can and when I think the game is in a better state.\\n\\nIf you want to try it out yourself to see what I\\'m talking about, and perhaps just feel that sick gameplay, I do recommend the game; I just can\\'t tell anyone to try playing this game for a fun and enjoyable experience.'},\n",

The story is good, the setting looks amazing, it runs smoothly, plays smoothly, has fast fun action in a cyberpunk setting, and the only complaint is [i]how dare you make me feel things![/i] \\n\\nI could tell you more about the story or the gameplay, but that\\'s what the Steam Page is for, I love the grappling hook mechanic; it\\'s smooth, and when you hit it just right you feel [i]awesome[/i]. \\n\\nThere is a slight resolution issue where the top part of the screen is black, as though it\\'s on widescreen mode, but the bottom of the screen is just fine. It\\'s weird, it doesn\\'t fix regardless of resolution setting, but it doesn\\'t bug me as much as it might bug other people. The fact I can\\'t remove the version number from the top left of the screen bugs me more than the letterbox resolution issue. \\n\\nOverall, it\\'s a great time and I\\'m having a lot of fun with it, it\\'s honestly the sole reason I dislike Early Access games: I know I\\'m going to reach the end of the content and have to wait for more without getting the whole game and the story I\\'m so far very invested in.\\n\\n** Edited Review Below **\\n\\nAs of 10/08/23 I\\'ve now played a near total 6 hours of the game and completed all the EA content. I need more, I want more. Hopefully I don\\'t have to wait too long for the finished product but as of right now it\\'s a fun game with minimal combat, decent story, fun characters. You could probably speedrun the content in an hour, the story itself is probably 4-5 hours itself as long as you don\\'t die often, which admittedly I did.\\n\\nNo glitches, no bugs, the game says use MKB but again, zero issues on Steam Deck. The control map in the settings does show MKB controls which is probably where the Steam Deck verification \"Playable\" label comes from, but I made no adjustments to the settings.\\n\\nFull recommendation, if you liked Katana Zero and/or grappling hook/swinigng mechanics this is the easiest recommendation of my life.'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"Though I've only played for around 2 hours, I've gone through the entire game. There is a good amount of content here for what it is and more to come. Clearly inspired by Katana Zero, this game focuses much harder on the movement aspect of these games to great effect. Highly recommend the pick up if you are looking for something similar. \\n\\nThere are some complaints I have though, the main one being polish. While this game looks and plays great, there are some things that become apparent when you start playing. The settings don't reset when reloading the game. Some of the grammar in the dialog is messed up, probably an easy fix. Your grappling hook reel-in is tied to the up arrow, however if you put jump on the up arrow as I do in my platformers, it can cause some annoying movement, reeling in when you meant to jump and continue your momentum. Also speed-run mode, probably what will be the main draw for games like this, still displays cutscenes and dialog and can even bug out to the point of turning the screen completely black. This is early access though and I expect that these bugs and features will be ironed out for the final release.\\n\\nAs for the rest of it? Movement is smooth and flowing when the level allows for it, you can get REALLY fast here. Some of the levels are worse than others, requiring you to stop and wait for something before continuing on. Mostly a personal gripe, I like flowing and continuous movement in my games. And the OST, it slaps. Where can I find this music, I need it.\\n\\nOverall: 7/10 Very solid platformer with a good story and crisp movement. Some things need tuning but when the game is released, I suspect this will be an 8-9/10. Easily worth the money.\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"First and foremost, I need to say if you are somebody who has played purely from the demo and just picked up wherever your save file left off at, I strongly encourage you to scrap it and restart. There were a variety of wonderful touch ups and additions added to the beginning which, while not essential to view, are fun and can add nicely to some subtle moments. And who are we kidding this game is succinct and lovely to play through any number of times for the movement alone. Now to the actual review:\\n\\n\\nI have been invested in this game prior to its release, having played on the original demo available and the betas available at the given time, the game even then was passionate and filled with heart that greatly excited me for its final release. To my surprise, when it did actually release I already had access to the game, presuming it was an error or a final demo update I played through immediately.\\n\\nMuch to my surprise I had received the full game for free, at this point I'm still not sure if this was an error due to me having the demo and beta in my library or intentional on the developers part for the final release. This aside, I seldom feel obligated to comment on anything, but I was genuinely taken aback by this game having been granted the chance to play through it fully completed now. \\n\\nThe art and style was phenomenal and only grew stronger beyond the already released demo section. The integration of mechanics was tied nicely often with story beats and transitioned seamlessly into teaching applications of the mechanics directly in the platforming promoting alternate methods of using some of them. The platforming also encouraged creative problem solving for those looking for more unconventional solutions or speed running advantages. I'm avoiding talking on the story as it is incredibly well done for the tale it wishes to tell, and I am no one to spoil that. What I will say on it is that it is well structured in the sense the player is only as aware as they choose to be; which I think perfectly builds into the aesthetic and narrative itself. The games story delivers where it matters most, being heartfelt, meaningful, and while not getting so broad as to water down its core story. All in all, I loved this game, it vindicates the player and makes actions feel worth it even more so by that ending.\\n\\nFor nitpicks, most of my issues are realistically non-issues, and more so quality of life gripes(3).\\n-In the English translation specifically there are a variety of grammatical errors, however none are overly detrimental to the moment or the overall understanding of what's going on. \\n-There are a few issues in terms of optimization at this current point, the amount of assets present seems to be delaying the rate of level loading times which can lead to longer black screen load times. While load screens aren't entirely a bad thing, these also apply to falling off the map in which your speed run timer will keep running, which presents some issues.. \\n-The last is a more specific issue for those who played the demo. If you had a save file that had unlocked Legendary at that time period and was using it, upon beginning the full game from where you left off you were locked to that state and unable to change due to Legendary being an unlock feature, which required a full game restart to be able to change it. Given how this would be difficult to adjust I understand how this came to be a bug and may be helpful to simply make a toggle if the game reads the save as having that setting enabled prior to the unlock to allow for the player to adjust down to an appropriate play level to still earn the Legendary mode.\\n\\nTLDR; Game good, very pretty, heartfelt story, chain arm go zoom, and actually play from beginning. I wish the team the best, thank you for your wonderful game.\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': '[h1]SANNABI The Revenant[/h1]\\n\\nLet the anguish take control and swing for the fences. SANNABI The Revenant launches you over, under, and across the dystopian future with an agonizing vengeance. I’ve really fallen in love with the platformers recently published by Neowiz, such as Metal Unit and Skul: The Hero Slayer, which I had the pleasure to review. So when I caught wind of this project, developed by Wonder Potion, my heart leapt with anticipation. I had no idea what I was getting myself into.\\n\\nYou are a retired veteran soldier, who has gone away from the violence to a quiet life with your young daughter. Being a father is amazing, and the memories you create with your daughter are priceless. Life is bliss. Until you get a visit out of nowhere from someone in your past… who brings a pain that will soon become your driving force.\\n\\nSANNABI is a 2D action-platformer, but not like any other I remember playing. So far, in this demo version of the game, the enemies aren’t actually your main concern, the environment is. Not with spewing balls of lava or with bodies of water to drown in, but just by being itself. Sure, there are a few enemies here and there that you need to take care of, but I found myself being killed by the landscape I was trying to latch onto (or land on) more often than not.\\n\\nThis introduces the most difficult aspect of the game for me: the platforming is done mostly by swinging. Your chain-hook prosthetic arm gives you the ability to latch on to most of the surfaces from a distance, so you’ll use it to literally fly across the screen. Some of the objects you latch onto will let you redirect yourself off of them, giving it a controllable pinball feel.\\n\\nSwinging from one platform to the next sounds serene and calming, right? Not in SANNABI. This game takes the concept, represented in my mind most by a friendly neighborhood kid in a red and blue jumpsuit, and smashes it into a mixer with bolts of body-jolting electricity and break-neck speed. Which is where the difficulty comes in. Most times I was swinging so fast I had hardly enough (if any at all) time to react and shoot my chain-hook at the next ledge. And if that wasn’t difficult enough, some of the surfaces are too sheer to grab onto, or even electrocuted. Partner this with insta-deaths when touching electricity, and a very low threshold to take damage from enemies, and this is one of the more difficult games to get the hang of in recent memory.\\n\\nSANNABI takes place in MAGO. The city of MAGO is a dark, neon-lit technological metropolis set in a retro graphics aesthetic. From what you recall, the city was run by a criminal faction when you were an active soldier. in the time I spent on this game, I felt enveloped by the dark atmosphere, like a vigilante launching myself over buildings in a permanent nightfall. The music was very “cyber-esque” and set the perfect backdrop to the stage.\\n\\nSANNABI was a really fun experience. This small taste of the story has me excitedly anticipating the full release of the game. However, the action and mechanics applied were extremely difficult to wrap my fingers around. I’ve never been good with fast paced games on the keyboard, because my fingers usually move off of the keys due to excitement. This problem came out in full force as I played through this demo. The ability to play with a controller is there, but it only made things even more difficult. It uses the same controls to move your character as it does to aim your chain-arm. The option to customize the configuration would make the experience a million times better. This being considered, though, I still really enjoyed this experience, and look forward to more. I’m hyped to swing for the fences in the full game.'},\n",

This may not turn off all players but for me personally the story here was not that engaging or interesting. I began skipping the cut-scenes which thankfully you are able to do.

       "  'Review Content': 'The game\\'s story goes from 0 to 100, really fucking fast, and and it\\'s the highlight of the game, by far. Characters are interesting, and it does have some funny moments here and there for what I would describe overall as a pretty dark and dystopian atmosphere. The mystery that\\'s going on isn\\'t cut and dry, so you\\'re kept guessing what\\'s going on. The only \"twist\" that you could see coming from a mile away is essentially having to go through this game\\'s version of the Mines of Moria. Only small nitpicks are that the game does have a few small typos here and there, and some world building gets left out. One example being when the main characters mention that the government says some research is banned and illegal, and I\\'m sitting here wondering, \"Why is it illegal? Was there some event that led to it being made illegal?\" But again, nitpicks.\\n\\nMy only gripes are that the main mechanic of the grappling arm doesn\\'t control very well in some places, the platforming can be really tight in some areas, and it makes it difficult to tell how you\\'re supposed to progress through some areas, as in, \"where am I supposed to go? I can\\'t see anything on the screen to latch onto\". For context, I\\'m playing with a controller here, so maybe it\\'s less finicky with a keyboard and mouse? Additionally, there are times that it feels like the invincibility frames after getting hit are way too short, and I get that it\\'s meant as a recovery mechanic, but when some random platform goes into a danger zone, you\\'re knocked off, and some bullet randomly hits you and you get hit again by the danger zone...it gets kind of tiresome. I will say, I wish there was a type of general purpose dodge sometimes, that doesn\\'t involve getting hit.\\n\\nCombat\\'s pretty decent, the normal mooks aren\\'t too much trouble and it\\'s insanely fun to zip around the map killing enemies. That is, until this one enemy starts showing up partway through chapter 2, and turns some fights into less of a combat encounter, and more of a puzzle fight, and not in a good way. Having to maneuver enemies into certain positions gets really annoying, but outside of that section, that particular enemy did not reappear in chapter 3, which is the furthest you can go at the time of review.\\n\\nBoss fights on the other hand are much more entertaining, with a few small hiccups here and there for some fights. The only downside I can say is that there\\'s no checkpoint system for any of them, so if you die at any point, you\\'re starting at the beginning of the fight once again. It\\'s a pro for some people, a con for others. It\\'s not that bad for the first boss since it\\'s not the longest boss fight in the world, but it becomes a pain for the second, especially considering how many times you need to knock them down, and the \"process\" to knock them down...\\n\\nOverall, the game\\'s pretty entertaining for what\\'s there, and I\\'m pretty invested into the story at this point, so I\\'m really interested to see where it goes.'},\n",

This game's highs are jubilant, featuring some of the most freeing movement in a 2D platformer and a story that subverts one's expectations in a way that feels earned and powerful rather than a cheap plot point like many lesser stories.\\nInversely, however, this game inspired such frustration within me that I had not previously thought possible, with the game's targeting system with the hook and the late-game charging move. (I am aware that there is a setting for aim-assist for the hook, but I had problems both with it on and off.) I also encountered several bugs during the final boss fight in which the boss would freeze in an idle pose with full invincibility. (In hindsight, I believe this was caused by resetting to last checkpoint on the frame she was transitioning from or to a move) This game was also originally written in Korean, as while it is very well localized, the translation itself features some minor errors and, more importantly, many vague sentences that make it unclear what exactly is happening.\\nThis game has undeniable faults, but I still recommend it to anyone who enjoys intense 2D platformers or, thanks to the game's many difficulty options, anyone who would be interested by a heartstrings-pulling story. I would also highly recommend playing on keyboard and mouse, as despite the unwieldy keybindings, you may edit them as you choose and aiming the hook is significantly more satisfying. \\n...Yeah, I think that about covers it.\"},\n",

There was much more story than I was expecting, with probably 1/4 of the time playing being plot-driven/narrative-based. While I wish there was less story than this, that's mainly because of how the main gameplay works - as I said, it's fast-paced and the movement feels super smooth, so it can be a bit jarring to go from that to a discussion between characters. Ultimately, I think the devs delivered this juxtaposition as well as they could with an engaging storyline to boot. Aside from that, the only other thing I wish was different is that in some areas, hitting terrain that hurts you (primarily areas with red lasers), you can easily get stun-locked into dying. It's not a big deal given save points are frequent, but there were several times I hit a laser and knew I would have to wait for it to hit me three more times so I could die and start over instead of having the chance to reposition myself (which would be more skill-expressive, IMO) and carry on.\\n\\nSANABI has a little bit of everything going for it - action, adventure, platforming, combat, a relevant storyline, and a fantastic soundtrack to accompany it all.

Short of perfect because of some mistranslation in the dialogues that causes some \"huh?\" moments. But I am sure it can be improved later on\\n- One of the most well-made pixel art style that blends incredibly well into gameplay\\n- Once you get familiar with the controls, the speed is quite addicting. Great fuel for adrenaline rush\\n- Oh man the [i] music.[/i] Goes super well with the flow and state of the game\\n- Levels can go pretty long in between cutscenes\\n- Great boss fights\\n- Amazing background art and atmosphere\\n- Good characters, although they lean into the tropey side early on\\n\\n[h1] Cons: [/h1]\\n- [spoiler] After knowing the whole story, Mari\\'s actions throughout the game are hard to justify to me [/spoiler]\\n\\n- Voice acting could vastly improve the story experience. The emotional moments do not hit as hard without voice acting. Though I understand the reason why there is no voice acting for a retro-styled game to keep the classic vibe.\\n- You live and die by the grappling hook. Although you get some power-ups to your character and your hook, you literally do not use anything else. Would be nice to have a button to trigger some hacker girl\\'s abilities whenever shes with you for more flexibility and options in gameplay\\n- The cutscenes may break the pace of the game for some people, especially the \"slow walk\" scenes. Imagine the pace of the game going from 100 to 10. Thankfully there are long levels in between major cutscenes.\\n- Very Linear levels, there is zero exploration. I personally prefer some kind of exploration for hidden lore or dialogues, but there is none here\\n- Camera does not pan fast enough sometimes, leading to deaths\\n- Muffin needs more presence in the cutscenes. It is only expressive very early on, the other times it is just a vehicle for Mari\\n\\nTLDR;\\n8/10. Nothing comes as close as capturing vibe of speeding through a 2D neon cyberpunk world as this game, supplemented by an amazing story. Please buy it if you are looking for what I have described, you won\\'t regret it.\\n\\nI will be looking forward to the next game from Wonder Potion. If they could learn from some of the shortcomings from this game, I believe the next game has the potential for a masterpiece.'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': '-takes a deep breath- okay, let\\'s talk about Sanabi.\\n\\nNot sure how this game found itself on my wishlist, but I\\'m glad it did. I grabbed it on a small sale and saw a lot of the reviews praising this game and saying it is similar to Katana Zero, another great game I love. Upon finishing Sanabi, I have to say, this is one of the best 2D action games I have played. I feel like it is Katana Zero meets Celeste. Let\\'s dig in.\\n\\nYou play as a retired General who is spending time with his lovely daughter. While living the good life and using your awesome grapple hook arm, your daughter heads inside your home and sees a clock with the name \"Sanabi\" on it. Before the General can warn her, she dies in the explosion. Days have passed, the General now wants to hunt Sanabi for the death of his daughter. He takes on a mission to enter a city where are the humans have mysteriously vanished. All, but one. A woman has sent a distress signal from inside the city. Your mission is to figure out why all the humans have disappeared from the city and to get the woman out of there alive.\\n\\nSanabi is a 2D action platformer. The controls are tight and very fun to get used to. As the General, you will be jumping and grappling onto walls, platforms, and more as you traverse the city to complete your mission. I felt like I was playing Celeste but with a grappling hook as the levels got more and more complex. Everything is very simple to master and as you progress, you will learn one to two more skills that enhance the gameplay.\\n\\nThe pixel graphics are gorgeous as well as the music. I was bobbing my head to the great soundtrack as I was swinging across chasms and fighting enemies. The boss fights were very fun and memorable. However, gameplay aside, Sanabi\\'s strongest asset was its story. While playing, I kept thinking I had the story down, and then curveball after curveball hit me until I got to the good ending (which was so EFFIN good!!!).\\n\\nHowever, this game does have its flaws. While the story is very strong and beautiful, it also hinders the game as well. You know how Metal Gear Solid is a great game but it has long cut scenes? Sanabi has that same issue as there will be times you will be sitting through long scenes in between gameplay that will just break the flow. While these scenes are skippable, you really need to watch them to fully immerse yourself into the story. Some of the later levels really hit you with a skill check and may take a while to beat. I also had a bug here and there where my jump button was also tied to my grapple button, but a quick reset on the controls fixed this issue whenever it occurred. There were times when I got stuck in walls or laser grids that got me some cheap deaths, but nothing game-breaking.\\n\\nFinal verdict? This game has definitely planted itself into my top 10 games. I tried to keep my review short and sweet because I don\\'t want to spoil anything, but I just have to say, the scenes leading up to the end of the game literally had me in tears. I legit sobbed at the end of the game and I am so grateful I played it to the very end. The characters were great, the story was amazing, and the gameplay and boss fights were top-notch. This was a perfect indie game and I highly HIGHLY recommend you play this masterpiece. The story will slow you down and there may be a bug here or there, but the overall experience was just perfect and I praise the developers for a wonderful journey. Thank you for reading.\\n\\nPS: \"Getting to the End is not what\\'s important......\"'},\n",

This wouldn't be terrible if it wasn't for some rather tough sections that can lead to a lot of back to back deaths. The audio pausing was probably the most grating aspect tbh since you have this bombastic music playing then it stops for 5 seconds and then it comes back. When this is happening constantly it gets annoying. You may only experience this if you try playing on a higher difficulty like I did. \\n-I experienced some bugs where I was stuck to a wall and had to finagle a bit to get unstuck. There was even a time I glitched through a wall entirely and had to restart at a prior checkpoint to fix. Hopefully the devs can patch this out. \\n-No d-pad control when swinging. \\n\\nDespite all my criticisms this was a very unique and memorable game that I would like to return to at some point.

       "  'Review Content': 'A game I REALLY want to like but the more I think back on my time the more I feel like there is a huge wealth of missed potential.\\n\\nThis game demands both speed and precision, however there are numerous pitfalls (metaphorically and VERY literally) that hinder the overall experience. This is almost exclusively because of level design. There is almost always an instant-death pit beneath you, meaning that one minuscule mistake will cause you to restart however you are encouraged to go as fast as you can due to the many timed puzzles and pursuant enemies driving your forward. You can become stunlocked and die with no way to recover and the sheer amount of information you need to be processing in the later levels is nothing short of insane. It\\'s like you\\'re expected to fail just so you can see what\\'s coming up ahead. Once you know what you\\'re meant to be dealing with the game becomes much easier to enjoy as you can actually plan your next moves. As a result I feel like this game would benefit strongly from a slow-down mechanic. Maybe it can be tied to certain actions you perform or simply a button toggle but if I could have had even a second to take a breath and assess my surroundings my frustrations would have almost completely vanished.\\n\\nThe art in this game is beautiful, the music is fantastic and the characters are engaging (although the story does beat you over the head for way longer than it should about certain plot points). When the level design allows it you can really fly through the city and simply enjoy traversal. Heck, even the combat is fun for how sparse it is.\\n\\nHowever there is a specific boss \"fight\" that goes on for FAR too long. It was such a long encounter that there are multiple checkpoints IN the encounter itself, and the difficulty of what you\\'re supposed to do isn\\'t consistent. Some \"cycles\" are nigh-impossible to do in time without knowing what you\\'re dealing with ahead of time while others are so easy you could do them in a wheelchair. And this sporadic difficulty is all over the game, there\\'s no real sense of difficulty progression because the problem is often \"you don\\'t know what\\'s ahead? Better die and figure it out on your second try\". And then when you DO get ahead you have to repeat the process allllllll over again.\\n\\nI think the best way of summarising my feelings is this:\\nInstead of \"cyber Spider-man\" I got \"trial and error: the reckoning\".\\n\\nThere is a good game here, it just wasn\\'t hitting the right notes for me. Too many issues were compounding on one another and the only thing keeping me engaged was the story and character interaction. Despite my frustrations I\\'d say there\\'s more to enjoy than dislike here, even though it seems like I\\'ve done nothing but rant endlessly.'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': 'So, I\\'m not quite done yet, but I felt the need to write a review for this one before I finish it up.\\n\\nThis game is a beautifully paced tide of intensity, starting with a simple layer of movement, and then the mechanics start packing on and punching in to make the pace frantic, the combat hectic, and the overall result a pulse-boosting, emotionally captivating experience. Soundtrack is absolutely bonkers level of tasty synthwave/electronic goodness. EXTREMELY high quality. The pixel art and general spectacle of the game are fantastic. Writing somehow manages to balance grittiness and some level of comic relief without feeling forced or having any \"Well THAT just happened\" moments. The highs are high and might give you a chuckle, and the lows will hit ya right in the gut.\\n\\nLevel design is generally great, with a few small sections that I found a little irritating, but were eventually passed with relative ease on the normal difficulty once I took a moment to step back and put on a momentary cap of thinking for five seconds and actually controlling my movement. Certain sections have a bit of a learning curve, so some levels will rack up the death counter, but if you really dig into the movement mechanics you mechanically feel like a dang superhero by the last few sections of the game. \\n\\nMy best recommendation without spoiling anything is, when you are given the option to rerun the tutorial, do it a handful of times, mess around with the movement, get a feel for the speed and what directional inputs do while you\\'re swinging. I ran the tutorial around 5 or 6 times because it\\'s less than a minute long and I genuinely feel like it enriched my experience with the game.\\n\\nIt\\'s also consistently adding in new little mechanics to make sure that movement never goes stale and ensuring that they tie into that delicious, delicious worldbuilding.\\n\\nThere are difficulty settings across the board from \"You have infinite health and can only die in pits/instant kills, enjoy the story\" to \"A single fart from an enemy kills you\". Also has a speedrun mode that you unlock, presumably after beating the game once. If I had to guess it\\'s probably the levels and bosses in rapid sequence with cutscenes removed.\\n\\nGame is positively dank. As I said, not quite done yet but I\\'m really, REALLY enjoying it. Kind of hoping that the game hits me with a plot twist and like six more hours of game.\\nIf you like platformers, snag it, it\\'s already relatively cheap.'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"This was a very enjoyable experience, especially for early access. The controls feel smooth for the most part though there are some areas where the grappling felt stiff mostly when turning some corners. Combat felt awesome, dashing around from enemy to enemy felt satisfying and while simple there were some mechanics that can make things interesting. Being able to dash after being hit is a nice recovery option and I can't wait to see how speedrunners abuse this tactic. You can go really fast in this game and swinging around felt fun, though I hope to see a little more enemy variety in the full version. The final boss was definitely the biggest highlight of the game for me. All of the other bosses were great as well but I felt this one definitely will test your grappling skills the most.\\n\\nThe story and characters were nicely written. The story goes from seemingly cheerful to dark pretty fast and early on. I like the concept of the world, with it being some sort of cyberpunk Korean setting with shadowy corporate conspiracies. The characters have enough charm to keep things from being overly mopey, and the game throws in cute references and doesn't take itself too seriously but manages to keep you invested in what's going on. The character designs were also good. One of my favorites was the Gun Head boss encountered at the beginning of the game. The look of the city is fantastic, though I wish there was a little more variety in terms of level aesthetic.\\n\\nAs someone who is eager for the Katana Zero dlc I feel this game was able to scratch that itch while also being able to retain a distinct identity on its own. The comparisons were inevitable, and while it doesn't quite strike the same chords I feel that SANABI is on its way to becoming something great and I look forward to playing the finished version when it comes around.\"},\n",

You play as the retired army general on the path of vengeance. Attached to your shoulder is the Chain Arm - part weapon, part grappling hook that you use to not only swing around the dystopian cyberpunk streets of Mago city, set in Korea. The Chain Arm is also used to...\\n\\n*checks notes*\\n\\n...rip enemies apart in an instant.\\n\\nThis is a one-hit kill platformer that makes you feel powerful when you pull off a sick move, and like an absolute loser when you whiff it. Speedrunners rejoice - this is the one you're looking for. There are various tools to traverse the environment, boosting through swings with your Chain Arm at the right moment will propel you to the next area in a single swift move. Memorizing the environment will make it even easier to chain your movement from zone to zone quickly.\\n\\nWhich is a bit of a shame because...the environment is beautiful. Mago city is full of neon lights, industrial corridors, and beautifully-designed robots both friend and foe. The game gives massive Katana ZERO vibes, with the fast-paced nature of Super Meat Boy and similar wall-jumping platformers in the genre - all wrapped up in tasty cyberpunk vibes.\\n\\nThere are some minor graphical issues in some of the cinematics, and there were TINY but noticible performance issues I while playing. But this review was made literally hours after the game's early access release so there's still time to tune these things up.\\n\\nI have a lot to play and experience in Sanabi so far, but if you're a fan of fast-paced platformers like Katana ZERO and Super Meat Boy then you're really going to like this one.\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': 'Sanabi is as satisfying to play as it looks, boldly making another case for the ol\\' question: \"Does a grappling hook make every game better?\". In the case of this cyberpunk platformer, the answer is yes. Drawing heavy visual and storytelling inspiration from the fantastic Katana: Zero, Sanabi is a story about transhumanism, capitalism, trauma, and family. While in some cases the anti-capitalist nature of the story comes off as ham-fisted especially as it conflicts with its seemingly pro-militarist narrative, the game is at all times tongue-in-cheek with it\\'s delivery of this message (there is a painting of Elon Musk in one of the levels). Aside from thematic criticism, the writing in Sanabi is occasionally muddied by what is clearly haphazard translation from Korean to English, but this is a criticism specific to the English version and I can\\'t speak for other versions of the game. Overall I thought the writing was very good, with good dramatic and comedic timing, so this is more of a nitpick than anything.

The waiting paid off and the release is truly a wonderfully executed, finished game.\\n\\nAs great as the music, the art style and the combat is - I'm mostly happy that the developers stuck the landing on the campaign and delivered an amazing story that quite frankly is even better than Katana Zero's. It hit me in the feels like KZ didn't.\\n\\nA lot of comparisons with Katana Zero have been made - in a very positive sense ofc, but now having finished the game I can honestly say, that the comparisons should probably stop. Yes, the music and the art style is just as great, but apart from that Sanabi stands on its own. It has it's own unique gameplay, that is far closer to Celeste than Katana Zero. Traversing levels at 'high octane' speeds and killing enemies along the way has a very different feel compared to KZ. The boss fights are all unique and fun. The difficulty is even on Veteran mostly fair. There were one or two passages in Chapter 3 or 4 where the next checkpoint was a little bit too far away and you had to repeat 'a little bit' too much for my taste but otherwise it was a great experience. \\n\\nWhat is also interesting to note is, that the further you get in the campaign, the more abilities you unlock and the more fun (!) traversing levels actually becomes. I thought that was quite a feat, because usually the further you get in a game the more difficult and frustrating it simply gets - this is somewhat true for Sanabi as well, but trust me, you will have the best time in the game when you blast through the last chapter with all your abilities unlocked.  What a great finale and feeling, when you reach the ending!\\n\\nUh yeah, so.... recommended! In fact..a tie for Game of the Year for me (with BG3 and Dave the diver)\"},\n",

But most of them share the same point:\\n\\nThat this game is phenomenal, in so, so many ways, and one that you shouldn’t miss. \\n\\nThe grapple hook is done extremely well here, and, with the other mechanics it introduces, makes you feel like a boss as you zip across the screen, killing enemies with crunchy sound effects and a badass soundtrack.\\n\\nThe story starts off pretty simple, but, at least for me, it was quite engaging (hey, maybe I don’t have taste, I don’t know). But as it unravels, there are twists that completely table the turns and a satisfying ending that blows your socks off and leaves you hungry for more (yeah, it’s satisfying, but as soon as it ended, I was like “that’s it?”). I heard that the developers were making DLC, which I hope is true, and really hope is coming soon. \\n\\nThe characters here are great too, and, throughout a game, you really do feel a connection to them. Mari serves as a great side character, adding humor to the game and strengthening its many serious moments. \\n\\nI do have a minor nitpick with this game, which is when you fall off a cliff or die. When you die, the music completely stops, it pauses for a few seconds, and then you start back at a checkpoint. It kills the flow of the game and I feel it would have been better if the game involved quicker deaths and allow you to get back into it faster (according to my memory, it did this for ONE BOSS FIGHT, and I frankly wish it did this for the whole game. I did do this on normal mode, and didn’t try it on legendary or other difficulties. The pause button also speeds things up a bit, although it still pause the music and you still have to wait).\\n\\nRegardless, this is just one small blemish on a masterfully crafted painting, and it beats out most 59.99 and now 69.99 games out there (for the sweet, sweet price of 14.99).\\n\\nSo just get it.'},\n",

Since the game is early access the story isn't finished either yet but what's there is polished, I didn't encounter any bugs/glitches.\\n\\nPros:\\nGameplay: The main mechanic of the grappling hook can get a bit to get used to but when you do it's super fun. \\nArtstyle: Despite being pretty similar to something like katana zero in theme (pixel art cyberpunk) the game looks pretty different but still nice with energetic animations and gorgeous backgrounds. \\nStory/World: What drew me in the most was the world itself, it's super interesting and I can'T wait until the story is finished and we get to know about all the secrets.\\n\\nCons: \\nthere are a few things that got a little bit annoying while playing.\\nGameplay: Occasionally I found it difficult to keep track of the levels, what I could grapple on, where enemies were etc. Sometimes it also feels like you can't beat the level on the first try because you need to know what is off screen. [spoiler] This was mainly in the overseer section[/spoiler]\\nVisuals: When moving at higher speeds it got a bit difficult to distinguish which surfaces you could hook on and which you couldn't. A similar issue also happened with background sections looking too much like they're in the foreground as well.\\nStory: [spoiler] The story seems pretty predictable with the main characters having a plan -> something goes wrong at the final step -> they use a different plan. I also felt like the gameplay/story ratio was a bit too skewed towards story at times.[/spoiler]\"},\n",

Taking obvious influence from Katana Zero, the combat and controls in this game are easy to learn and fun to master. By the end of the story, you're blasting through each level and it feels so satisfying. I really appreciated the lack of rankings and collectibles to better focus on the incredible story. I truly did not anticipate the twists and turns this game brought, but even more-so how the story stayed easy to follow. I was never truly lost on what was going on in the story, any more than the games narrative was intentionally pacing itself for. The pixel art in this game is just gorgeous. Each area has a distinct art style separating it from the last and SEVERAL screenshot worthy stills presented by the story. The soundtrack is littered with the main theme which is always a treat to hear weaved into hard synth tracks all the way into the more somber tracks. There are also several moments of humor that were always in good taste and never skipped a beat to present them.\\n\\nThis game truly is a 10/10 for me. It masters tight controls, great storytelling, beautiful visuals, & atmospheric music all into a very reasonable price for the length of the story (~12 hours). If you liked Katana Zero, Ruiner, Hotline Miami, you will love everything that Sanabi has to offer.\"},\n",

It's almost a shame to put such a fun game mechanic in such a story-heavy game. \\nThere's a few moments of bad level design (some jumps that you need to make offscreen with little to no indicator that that's where you need to go) and the pacing really drags during the middle, but it has a rewarding ending so overall I'd say it's worth it. Whatever this studio does next I'll be checking out. \\nTL;DR this game spend half of its time ruling and the other half of the time playing like a visual novel, and both parts work well in a vacuum but together they tend to clash. A solid pick for fans of the Ori series and Night in the Woods. If neither of those games do anything for you, you probably won't be too impressed. \\n\"},\n",

No other game has come close to the level of emotional impact SANABI can provide, and I hope I'm wrong when I say nothing will again. The gameplay starts a little later, but is very easy to pick up and becomes familiar and extremely satisfying in no time. Every single environment, every single character, is crafted to perfection and refined even further into a masterpiece. Just look at how many reviews are positive here, and ask yourself if so many people can be wrong about a game this good?\\n\\nTo be clear: This game is NOT for everyone. There are people who will find it too easy, there are people who will find sections too difficult. There are people who will find the story too short, there are people who will take issue with the story slowing down a fast-paced platformer. There are people who will love this game as much as I do and people who will find a flaw to fixate on and let it ruin their enjoyment of it.

Everything from the story, to the music and the gameplay was so wonderful. My only complaint I have is with one of the aspects of the gameplay, getting stun locked and dying in those DAMN RED BOX DANGER ZONES, it really kinda broke the flow of the gameplay, if you get caught in them the knockback from taking damage knocks you back into them making it impossible to get out of it and just ends up killing you. So yeah that;s my only complaint though. Everything else was PERFECT. The story had a twist I didn't see coming even with the constant hints they kept dropping to me. The story will really make your heart throb. The game does have some slight Katana ZERO vibes but I honestly found this game a lot more enjoyable compared to Katana ZERO overall.

I had never heard of it before, but seeing the overwhelmingly positive review score, I decided to listen to what seemed to be the general consensus and go in blind. Now, after having finished the game, I absolutely agree with the sentiment. The story in this game is deep and emotional, and full of twists and turns. I can't, in good faith, say more than that, and if you have any interest at all in this game, go in completely blind. The gameplay revolves around your grappling hook arm, and features a lot of aerial movement. The game provides a decent challenge, and has incredibly fun and fluid movement that makes it feel good to go fast and pull off tricks, or just finish certain more difficult sections. The controls are responsive, and you can feel your momentum carry over in your movement without feeling too floaty. The combat in the game is an extension of the movement system, and fighting enemies furthers the momentum instead of bringing the gameplay to a halt. The pixel art is nothing short of beautiful, with several unique and cinematic locations and backgrounds. I will say, the English translation isn't perfect, and there are some lines that don't quite make sense and need to be read over more than once, but it was still very understandable and didn't really hamper my enjoyment of the story. I would absolutely recommend the game, especially if you like platformers, pixel art, and crying over said pixel art.\"},\n",

I felt rather motivated to make it to the next screen as fast and efficiently as possible in order to achieve my objective and learn more about what is going on in this cursed city. [/i]\\n\\nThe gameplay I found a bit easy at times and a handful of b.s. deaths in all my 11 hours to fully beat it. Literally just a handful, the moments where it felt unfair were exceedingly rare. It\\'s solid, responsive and fun but nothing too amazing or innovative that\\'ll make me want to come back to it much. Its does its job and it does it well. Specially with how many gameplay elements are carefully introduced and woven into story moments to where its just obvious what to do in the next scene without having a popup, tutorial message nor obnoxious highlights and arrows pointing to \"USE THIS BOMB HERE\"\\n\\nNow where the game TRULY shines for me is in the story. There is plenty of foreshadowing and things that were carefully written to keep the world consistent and making sense even among the insanity of what the main character is going through. Granted there are a couple odd translation moments but no typos nor anything that will just pull you out of it and ruin the moment. Everything is always clear and easy to understand, just a couple oddities with the way the languages work such as not knowing which pronoun to use on a specific character. Simply put its amazing. From the tutorials playing with the character\\'s daughter the story is already digging its hooks into you and all the time its building up to the final grand reveal. A reveal that if you were paying attention from the beginning you could largely piece together already but is still satisfying in how it shows you the details of how everything happened and comes together.\\nslight spoiler: [spoiler] pay attention to how the characters talk phrases they say, you\\'ll notice patterns* [/spoiler]'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"I can confidently say SANABI is probably one of the best games I've ever played. \\nTL;DR: Amazing game, play it now, thanks Wonder Potion for making something this good.\\n\\nMost games have movement systems that make either the combat OR the platforming engaging, leaving the other as boring filler that unnecessarily fills up the game. This game capitalizes on both, having some of the most fun combat AND platforming of any game I've ever played. How does it achieve this? The protagonist's signature chain arm and other movement abilities, beyond being cool as heck, give the player unrestricted freedom over exactly where they need to go, how fast they need to get there, whether they need invincibility frames when getting there, etc. Pretty much any mistake or screw-up in this game is entirely the player's fault, while every success is a result of the player's skill, and adds to the feeling of flow the game allows. There's no better feeling than being able to breeze through multiple checkpoints in a row without dying or falling out of the map. \\n\\nThe game offers different difficulty options for different people based on the experience they want (ex: I would imagine someone wanting to experience the story alone would probably pick Easy, where your character doesn't take damage, while people who want a challenging experience may pick Veteran(hard) or Legend(one HP)), so players have some level of control over their experience.  \\n\\nAs for the actual content in the game itself, the game is roughly 15 hours long with 5 levels. Each level has a different setting, platforming mechanics, BGM (this game has a really good soundtrack), and enemies. While different, all of these levels are fun and enable a player to achieve the flow state I was discussing earlier. The last level in particular is what I believe to be the best level I've ever played through in a video game in terms of mechanics, writing, and pure fun factor. Furthermore, there are a number of bosses spread throughout the game, all of which are fair, look pretty cool, and are a blast to fight. \\n\\nVisuals: well, you've seen the trailers. The game looks gorgeous, with a beautiful pixel-crafted world that encapsulates the futuristic city we all imagined in our heads. The game uses visuals well, never being too overbearing and never taking away from the gameplay while perfectly telling the story of the place you're in. Furthermore, animations are solid as well, making the protagonist look cool as the player platforms through these levels while ripping apart every enemy in sight. \\n\\nFor the game's plot, I won't say anything except that it's really good. The plot centers around two characters, and their interactions throughout the game made me smile, laugh, and tear up at different points throughout the game. If you like a story with well written characters, play this game.\\n\\nIt's a great game, and you should definitely play it, especially if you like action platformers like Katana ZERO.\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"The Overwhelmingly Positive rating is well deserved. Originally, I was getting the impression this was a mid platformer with some nice graphics, but the game manages to stay fresh with each new area introducing one or two new mechanics which are combined well with previous ones. I would say you can tell by the 2nd area or so if this game is for you. I won't focus much on the positives here are my negatives:\\n\\n- The early story is sloooow. Not a slog, just slow, with more than a couple walking segments. I can see this would put off a lot of people from otherwise fast paced game unfortunately, but it only happens near the beginning.\\n\\n- The mystery of the story takes a while to start resolving, but by the time it does start, you kind of already know what the answers are going to be. Not to say it's unoriginal, but the themes have been tread before. That being said, I really like how this game's story plays out. I was interested all the way through to figure out what is going on. Some minor things are confusing at the end, and I spotted more than 1 plot hole, but it's nothing major.\\n\\n- There is a gauntlet at the end. The game has frequent saves so it's not a gameplay problem, but you're running through areas you've already been to, which is always annoying to me. Thankfully it is a lot faster this time around. That reminds me,\\n\\n- Levels are quite long some times. I finished in 9.8 hrs, and I played in one day in one sitting (because I really wanted to see how story pans out) so probably closer to 7 hours. On one hand, there is a lot of gameplay here, but at the same time a lot of that gameplay is the same mechanic throughout a level. It's not that the character is slow or anything either, the levels just start to drag at some point, especially Chapter 3 levels.\\n\\n- The boss near the end is annoyingly hard. I don't even know if I want to come back and do Legendary because of how annoying that boss was to fight.\\n\\nOverall, I will say the mystery and theme carries this game more than the gameplay. The gameplay is nice but I can easily see how it can feel padded or samey and boring. Unlike Katana Zero, if the game starts easy for you, it ends feeling just as easy. But if this isn't a deal breaker for you, it's a good game. Just a really well put together game with a really good story.\"},\n",

And it's also a poignant, gut-wrenching story about dying to get revenge and living with regret.\\n\\nThose two things don't sound like they really go together, and there was a point when I felt like they didn't. I almost quit the game because I was tired of it getting its own way. How many times is this game going to stop me in the middle of an intense grappling hook section to dump more talking heads in my lap?\\n\\nBut I'm glad I stuck with because the payoff is more than worth it. \\n\\nThe grappling hook goodness, the surprisingly gripping story, the gorgeous and emotive pixel art that makes the characters come alive more than a lot of AAA games, and one of the best video game soundtracks ever recorded -- this game has so much going for it. \\n\\nHighly, highly recommended\"},\n",

And while that is mostly true, I wanted to clarify that although similar Sanabi is not just a Katana Zero sequel. The art style and setting is similar yes. And the story is the same to the extent where both are about a power larger than you that is going to have you sitting on the edge of your seats wanting to get to the end. The story overall is still significantly different than that of Katana Zero. The game play is quite different too. It is much more platform based than Katana zero and for the most part has zero time dilation. If you played Katana Zero, you will like this game. But if you are wary that this game is clone know that it a great, fleshed out world, with unique characters and story, and a fabulous movement system.'},\n",

The last section of the game, when you zip through the areas from all the other chapters and revisit their mechanics, is amazing to play through. \\n\\nThe hardest difficulty is definitely the best way to play through the game, as it feels so rewarding to get through sections without taking a single hit. It also makes the combat sections, which are too forgiving on the normal difficulty, much more intense and satisfying to get through. The only time I got annoyed with this difficulty though, was in the final two boss fights. The pattern of attacks these enemies use is too random. When I finally beat them, I felt more that I had gotten lucky that they chose an easier sequence of moves rather than feeling that I had truly mastered them.\\n\\nThe story is interesting, but it interrupts the flow of the game. There are so many cutscenes.

So 9/10 for soundtrack\\nAs for the third point, the movement is great and the combat is simple enough to master and complicated enough to mess up sometimes, and the movement animations are great and satisfying. So 10/10 for the movement and combat\\nAs for the fourth point, every boss fight was different and harder than the one preceding it and they fit in well with the story.

The minute to minute gameplay and near limitless skill ceiling is captivating, and the storyline especially blending with gameplay choices in chapter 5 is stunning.

       "  'Review Content': '[h1]2D platformer that\\'s filled with good music and gameplay and over swelling plot[/h1]\\n\\nSANABI is a game where player take\\'s control of a retired soldier whose right hand is replaced with a giant grappling hook. This weapon allows player to traversal stages with style and takeout foes very efficiently. Alongside completing maps by getting from left end to right end, player gets to experience a story filled with dystopian scifi-city, cold determination and comic reliefs delivered by npc\\'s. Throughout the game there\\'s great pixel art and soundtrack presence.\\n\\nThat is until certain point of a story (where player has to [spoiler]choose the ending[/spoiler]) where I think game starts to fall partly flat with some of the praises I just presented.\\n\\nLet\\'s start from the first thing after [spoiler]choosing going up the stairs[/spoiler], boss fight against [spoiler]Major Song[/spoiler]. Up to this point it\\'s been always clear what player needs to do in order to avoid getting hit and when/ how to strike back against the present boss. In this fight there\\'s very hard in middle of intense fight to read when attacking her is a good idea and not encountered by her. The [spoiler]final[/spoiler] chapter also struggles with flying foes equipped with [spoiler]swords[/spoiler] spawning indefinitely close to a player. What problem this causes is when player tries to do [spoiler]armor dash[/spoiler] against specific target (for example to [spoiler]move a container[/spoiler]) the game automatically aims for closest target that might be foe instead and limits player\\'s control of the situation.\\nAnd story... let\\'s just say that when [spoiler]Mari pretends to be so surprised about player character\\'s voltage level and worker ID she would not be only a master in IT-field but also in a poker game to fake out her expression through out the journey[/spoiler].\\n\\nVerdict:\\nSANABI feels to me like a good vanilla-chocolate ice cream in a waffle, which end part is filled with ginger or liquor. If you are up to a \"bionic commando\"-like 2D platformer and don\\'t\\' care about the story, SANABI is a great pick for it\\'s default asking price.

       "  'Review Content': \"\\n[h3] Gameplay: [/h3] \\nThe combat in Sanabi is inspired by 'Katana Zero' -- with the most obvious change from its combat being the swing mechanic. Swinging around always feels satisfying when pulled off, and means that you are always moving and swinging throughout the levels that have been carefully designed for that movement, but can feel finicky at times especially since it is such an unconventional mechanic and takes a while to get used to. The difficulty is also trying to mirror that of 'Katana Zero' and scales exceedingly well as the game progresses and different enemy types and complications to the game are added a a pace that keeps the gameplay interesting while not becoming overwhelming. The controls also work well on both on controller and mouse and keyboard since it allows you to you your cursor to aim which is refreshing seeing as most 2D platfromers on PC have pretty mediocre controls. The game also has a harder unlockable difficulty and a speedrunner mode and due to its short length of 9 hours is replayable, but don't expect to be playing it over and over again since most of the main fluff of the game is in that first playthrough. The length of the game also means that it doesn't overstay its welcome and means that each enemy encounter feels meaningful and fun.\\n\\n[h3] Visuals: [/h3] \\n'Sanabi' has gorgeous visuals that mix real-time lighting and fog with beautiful pixel art that blends well with the fast-paced combat that needs that clear visual clarity. The game will constantly pan over vast beautiful cityscapes that set the atmosphere for the game and act as a moment of reflection in between the intense combat sections and are an absolute joy to look at. \\n\\n[h3] Story: [/h3] \\n Sanabi's story is a mystery thriller with a captivating and engaging story that leads to some genuinely jaw-dropping moments, but is tainted with annoying characters and a weak ending. I found the secondary main character 'Mari' pretty frustrating, with lines that are distracting in serious moments and unfunny in the calmer ones. It also does have different endings according to your choices but it isn't a big aspect of the game. Only one choice affects the ending, and one of the endings is essentially just a cutscene, which feels like a waste of an opportunity. The longer, more fleshed-out ending didn't click with me as much as I would have liked, and felt like it wasn't the ending the game had been building up to.\\n\\n[h3] Music: [/h3] \\nSanabi's music is excellent, having adrenaline-pumping tracks with boss tracks being especially exhilarating and more serene slower-paced tracks that stick in your head long after you've beaten the game.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Sanabi can stand as its own next to the games that inspired it such as Celeste, Katana Zero, and Hotline Miami through its exceptional music, gameplay, visuals, and story and should get more of the recognition it deserves.\"},\n",

Possibly my favourite out of every one I've played this year, and I play a lot of them.\\nIt's partially because the game makes me feel like I'm absolutely busted at it, but also because the controls, mechanics, and story are incredibly tight. And fun.\\n\\nThe game's introduction of new mechanics are paced excellently; its core gameplay loop is enjoyable almost regardless of what level of the skill spectrum you land on; the story is intriguing in both themes and its beats, dropping just enough hints that a player is capable of solving its mysteries incredibly early while still remaining fuelled with a jet-fuel level of emotional oomph that'll keep the player pushing to the end.\\nIt's very, very good.\\n\\nThe only real criticism I have is on what is (technically) the final boss, whose mechanics are obscure in a way that encourages experimentation but tended to just leave me baffled. I'm still not sure why my shift would get blocked at some moments.\\nThat's literally my only criticism. I'd recommend this to anyone at all who even mildly enjoys platformers, and it's the cost of 1-3 burgers and I'd wager almost any PC can run it. Give it a go\"},\n",

One is the sort of whiplash you get with constant switching back and forth from gameplay and cutscenes. \\n\\nWhen you are having a lot of fun playing, the game stops you and has you experience a cutscene. \\nWhen you are excited by story progression, a new mystery is brought up, and becomes a cliffhanger that is interrupted by gameplay.\\n\\nThey don't want to info dump on you, but they kind of mess up the pace. A bunch of conversations investigate one idea and then for one reason or another, they have to drop the conversation and start running again. \\n\\nIt takes time for the story to get good because the main character is deadpan rude and does not allow conversations to progress very far. There is a purpose for it in the story, but I can see how it would get on someone's nerves. \\n\\nOnce the story begins dropping answers on you, it explodes into something amazing, and you wish you could just watch it like a movie. Shortly after, gameplay calls, and you will feel motivated to perform well and go wild only to still be stopped to interject small dialogue.\\n\\nDespite this, time is minimally wasted and it didn't hinder my enjoyment of the game.

       "  'Review Content': \"An honest review of SANABI - \\n\\nSANABI is undeniably captivating, weaving a tale of intense gameplay and immersive storytelling. Although, there are some setbacks to it. \\n\\nGameplay and Visual Charm:\\nSANABI's gameplay is a thrilling escapade, offering a challenging platformer that has its difficulty with a lot excitement. The 2D pixel art style, reminiscent of Celeste, adds a nostalgic touch, creating a visually compelling environment. The *initial* playthrough is a delightful rollercoaster, with engaging mechanics that set it apart from other games.\\n\\nReplay Value:\\nWhile SANABI looks fun for another round, its charm begins to disappear upon replaying. The story really loses its charm, it's just not interesting after you know the ending, and the achievements, omg. The achievements that are left after completing the game are some of the hardest ones. \\n\\nChallenges and Achievements:\\nSANABI introduces a commendable level of difficulty, reaching its zenith in the formidable Legend mode. However, the pursuit of achievements becomes a double-edged sword as the overwhelming challenge, particularly in beating the game on Legend mode, can deter even the most determined players. The lofty difficulty may alienate those seeking a more laid-back gaming experience, impacting the game's accessibility.\\n\\nCutscene Overload:\\nA notable drawback lies in SANABI's reliance on cutscenes, disrupting the harmony between storytelling and gameplay. The engaging storyline is occasionally overshadowed by an almost 50/50 split between cutscenes and interactive play. This imbalance, disrupts the game's rhythm and could potentially remove the amount of overall enjoyment. \\n\\nTime:\\nIt's really a short game, sadly. It's only got about 8 hours worth of gameplay, and like I said, it's about half cutscenes. I really loved this game, but it only being 8 hours really deterred me from it. If it were lengthier, I'd definitely rate it better than I will soon.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nSANABI stands as a commendable piece of indie gaming, offering an enthralling platformer with a narrative that initially captivates. However, the overabundance of cutscenes and the super difficult achievements in the latter part of the game pose hurdles to its long-term appeal. Nonetheless, for those seeking an adrenaline-pumping and challenging gaming experience, especially during the initial joyride, SANABI remains a solid choice. It IS worth the cost, 100%, 8/10 game.\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"I'm really on the fringe of recommending vs not recommending. The game was a 6~7 for me personally. It's a fast paced platformer with good pixel art and great gameplay. Controls are super responsive, levels are great and reward fast and aggressive play, soundtrack really stands out. It has some solid set pieces, and really ramps up tension for boss fights. Although the introduction was slow and boring, as soon as I got to the first real level, I thought this game might hold me over until Earthblade comes out. The thought ended about 20-30 minutes later.\\n\\nI do recommend this game on the gameplay and music alone. However, at least for me, it can't stand among the greats because of its presentation and writing.\\n\\nSpoilers for the first 30 minutes of the game that provide some additional context for my criticisms\\n[spoiler]\\nYour daughter dies at the beginning of the game, and the game goes edgelord immediately. Then 30 minutes in you'll meet another young girl who will accompany you and the game loses that tone immediately.\\n\\nThe story wants to drive a father + surrogate daughter narrative like the Last of Us Part 1, complete with the daughter figure being naive and cracking jokes. \\n\\nThe problem is, as you might expect, the quality of the writing and the characters is not good enough to make you care about the characters. Poor writing does impact the whole product negatively, but it would be a minor issue if the gameplay was the biggest priority. The problem is that the bad writing is given the same focus as the gameplay, and it got in the way of me having fun.\\n[/spoiler]\\n\\nEvery problem snowballs from here:\\n* The actual time it takes to scroll through text is WAY too long. The developers want to animate every line, but the cues are off and it takes 2-3 seconds to just get to the next line. This was a fatal flaw for me. The story constantly interrupted the gameplay, and I couldn't speed read past it,\\n* The quality of the writing is mixed, and pretty bad overall, at least it was in Japanese (I couldn't stand the English localization). It has its moments, but the sheer amount of time you spend in conversation gets in the way of the game's biggest strengths, its gameplay and music.\\n* The high quality pixel art in the first level shows what the game could have, but the second level is an industrial area made up of monotone browns that lack detail, and one boss is rendered as a 3D model whereas the other bosses are rendered with pixels. This shift in quality betrays the stellar visual presentation of the first section of the game, which is problematic because at this point I'm irritated with the dialogue. In the first section, having gorgeous visuals softened the blow.  The game makes up for this with strong art and presentation in the second half, however. \\n* Speaking of which, given the talent that the artists have, I don't understand why they decided to tell instead of show most of the story. The animations are fluid and gorgeous, but they play out mostly during dialogue, which is a waste.\\n* The final chapter of the game ties up the story and has really great gameplay, but it also has the most dialogue and some of it is unskippable. Also (minor spoiler) [spoiler]there's no final boss, the game instead closes on story beats. I don't know what could be a more fitting end to this review where my biggest complaint is that the story gets in the way of the gameplay[/spoiler] \\n* Last issue is minor. The game isn't hard and I wish the 1HKO difficulty was unlocked from the start.\\n\\n\\nI like this game, I recommend it, but I don't love it. There's a ton of talent and skill behind this game, which makes it all the more frustrating to see it get in its own way with poor presentation. Now I'm looking at Tevi as the next thing to calm me down for the long wait til Earthblade's release.\"},\n",

Last I remember was Grapple Force Rena, but that was significantly slower. Otherwise, once you get used to it and start picking up speed it gets pretty fast in a hurry. Otherwise, the one ability that is a bit finicky to use is the charge dash, but it's not TOO bad\\n\\nMain issue that the game can have is the abundance of cut scenes and slow walking. Some cut scenes are unskippable, which can get annoying for folk doing multiple playthroughs, and during the slow walking segments it's hard to tell what's a cut scene and what isn't.\\n* Since Speedrun mode isn't out yet, we don't have that yet for proper practice or anything, but that should be resolved soon.\\n\\nMusic is great. Not much to really say there they all fit their situations. The Long Voyage was great.\\n\\nStory is pretty strong, even if the translation is not the greatest. Typos, grammar issues, sometimes using the incorrect words entirely. Hopefully they can fix that all soon for future players.\\n\\nAll in all, good vidya. Play it.\"},\n",

That's how to make a good story in a linear game that doesn't feel like watching a cut-scene (actually there are lots of those, but the point is that the game as a whole doesn't feel like one). Interactive medium, and all that. I could write paragraphs about how good it is, and about all the things it did right, but then I would spoil it.

       "  'Review Content': \"Honestly one of the best platformers I have ever played (definitely one of the best I have played in years) and was really excited when the full release came out after playing early access last year, the pacing of the gameplay including great implication of puzzles elevate this game to the same level as other greats like celeste. Honestly recommend it to all my friends that love platformers. The caste of characters are all bubbly and have great dialogue and the art is katana zero level of good. For me its definitely a 9/10 and as the developers work on improving the game it will definitely reach 10/10. It is already a staple for me in the genre and in indie games in general so I will always sings it praises. so if you continue to read my review know that my critique for the game is from a place of love and I really recommend this game.\\n\\nHowever there are two problems that I hope the developers due read in my review that I hope they will address, one minor and one I think is pretty major\\nThe Minor problem is the lack of a break in certain sections, for example without going into spoilers, there is was a part in the game where you encounter three set pieces (major action parts/boss fights) that happen one after another. The player is unable to find a suitable moment to exit the game without feeling that if he quits now he would it would ruin the experience in some sort of way. What do I mean by this? Well after the set piece ends the player immediately enters a cut scene that he is unable to pause and save than safely exit, he would only be able to pause the game after he skips the cutscene (which why would you? the cut scenes are great) or allow it to play out. Now for most this might not be such a bad thing, it just means there is just a lot of exciting and cool events in the game that can make a player play for hours. However not every player is like that and most times after a major set piece especially after a boss fight would normally save and exit the game. So it is not to start the next part of the game. Now you can save and exit after the cutscene but I feel like if a player came back the next week to play the game he or she would forget the context of the major set piece he or she was playing in therefore slightly hindering the experience. What I propose is before a cutscene starts (one that leads to the next boss fight or event) after a major set piece that the player must first interact with Marie than does the event trigger therefore not hindering pacing plus allowing players that opportunity that they now feel safe to save and exit the game because unironically the part of the game that I'm talking about the player's character is extremely exhausted which was how I felt after the three set pieces in the row.\\n\\nThe major one is using the controller. Since I have played the game mostly on the M&K I had no idea about how controller was like in the game until I had it plugged in the other night and decided to use it. There is a feature in the game the slows down time kinda like in katana zero (I had no idea this was even a feature) that allows the player to aim the grappling hook to where he wants to go. Now I didn't even once use it when I was M&K let alone I had even forgotten it was thing until I picked up the controller. Why is the ability triggered when ever you aim the grappling hook with the joystick? it should be a separate designated button, as it ruins all pacing in the game and makes it incredibly sluggish and frustrating as I was so use to just moving around super fast and making quick second decisions. I quickly unplugged my controller after that and continued to have fun on the M&K but please devs make it a separate button like in katana zero. allow controller users to decide if they are going to use the slow down ability or not than just forcing it on them.\"},\n",

It has a a lot more platforming, and the grappling is quite different (and good fun). Even the combat is quite different, although again fun.\\n\\nWhile the platforming and combat is fun, it didn't blow me away on its own. What did blow me away was the total package for an indie studio (from what I can tell) making their first game. The length, pacing, music, and presentation are all superb, and more than worth the $12 I paid.\\n\\nThe pixel art is gorgeous, and the framing of so many scenes highlights the art even more. The music doesn't quite hit the heights of Katana Zero or Hotline Miami, but you get the pounding synth tracks for combat and then the slower and more quiet subtle tracks for the emotional moments. Really good stuff overall, and used in all the right places.\\n\\nThe game is also well paced, no single combat/platforming section or story section felt too long, keeping everything moving. Each area in the game introduces new mechanics specific to that area that also keeps you engaged and having to learn new things. No area feels too long or drawn out. By the end you are zipping along and it does feel good. Without spoiling anything, the last chapter in the game pays off the progression in game mechanics throughout the game beautifully.  The game is just the right length I felt too to let the story properly play out and unfold without dragging or any extra fat.\\n\\nGetting to the story- a lot of praise in the Steam reviews, and it is good. You get enough to put most of the puzzle together before the end, so you'll have some idea where it's going, but the way it unfolds is compelling, and you won't be able to figure eveything out before the end. The story really pays off emotionally with a touching ending too.\\n\\nWriting and text delivery deserves kudos too, a lá Katana Zero, so much tone, flow, and personality is exuded in the way text bubbles are presented, the way they overlap, sound, changes to the font, etc. The delivery really helps get you invested in the characters, specifically the main two, but also the side characters. Even characters who get little screen time I found myself caring about. The writing and characters really elevate an already solid plot.\\n\\nTo put a bow on it- all of these elements make for a game that's hard not to come away satisfied with. It just hits so many high notes on the presentation with the art, sound, story delivery, everything. The gameplay isn't super complex, but it is fast and fun, and it stays fresh, introducing new areas and mechanics at just the right pace.\\n\\nSpend $12, play this game. \\n\\nIf you have a Steam Deck, great way to play.\"},\n",

Though there is a healthy dose of killing bad peeps, unlike katana zero there is greater focus on platforming and the type of movement tricks ya can use with ya grappling arm.

OTOH, I [b]don\\'t[/b] want to recommend it because of the incomprehensible story (the spelling/grammar errors in the English translation certainly don\\'t do it any favors), the interminable cutscenes, and that the game seems determined to do everything in its power to get in the way of you enjoying it.\\n\\nHere\\'s the thing - the swinging is pretty fun! It feels good, the \"swing dash\" is honestly a really cool mechanic, and chaining together moves is really satisfying. But in the normal flow of gameplay, you get few opportunities to actually [b]DO[/b] any move chaining, thanks to all the barriers, walls you can\\'t latch on to, enemies shooting at you from a screen and a half away, etc. etc. ([i]Gravity Circuit[/i] this ain\\'t.) And I can not go any farther into this review without mentioning SANABI\\'s cardinal sin - the terrible, horrible, no good, very bad combination of overly bouncy knockback and a criminally short post-hit invincibility window.\\n\\nIf you ever hit the bottom edge of one of the red \"touch here and you get shot by an offscreen laser\" areas, you get bounced upward and thrown further into the red area, where you quickly get shot again, bounce up again, get shot again, rinse and repeat until you\\'re dead. And after you die, you\\'re treated to an instant halt of the music and a completely black screen for 5-10 seconds until it eventually gets around to restarting you at the last checkpoint. ([i]Celeste[/i] this ain\\'t). The same sort of pause happens every time you fall into one of the game\\'s numerous pits as well (including when you slide into one by accident, because there\\'s no real way to tell if the bottom of the screen is a pit or the way you have to go to the next section of the level).\\n\\nThankfully, there is a way to mitigate these issues somewhat - do yourself a favor and set the difficulty to Easy. When you don\\'t take any damage, there\\'s actually a chance for there to be some flow to the proceedings and it makes the game much more enjoyable as a result. I did that for Chapter 5 - after nearly rage-uninstalling due to the Chapter 4 boss, where falling in the pit at the bottom of the area resets [i]the entire fight[/i] - and the experience was much improved.\\n\\nI look forward to the next game from Wonder Potion - if they figure out how to make gameplay worthy of their art and music, it\\'ll truly be something special.'},\n",

It\\'s what I wanted from a remake of Bionic Commando with a modern take, but it\\'s even dumb to say this as this is something special.\\nGame is great, highly recommend it if you like 2D platforming and speed. \\n\\nThat being said, take this as something I would prefer in the future and not really unremitting points of the game:\\n- Some levels / stage mechanics are underutilized or just redundant in the mechanics. Such as pushing stuff, it always goes back to place, but other things like cranes never do, it makes for weird design consistency and the pushing is highly underutilized\\n- Most of the mechanics are only used because of red walls blocking you, which makes for really stale mechanics\\n- Dialogue is HEAVILY repetitive, tons of information or plot structure happens too frequently, such as characters having conversations cut short by something or not answering questions, it could be cleaned up a bit more\\n- The \"limit removal\" could\\'ve been cooler, make the tackle not have a wait time and make the limiter feel even more powerful, because as is it feels just as a convenience\\n- Could\\'ve used more boss fights, the ones in here are ok but running away boss fights could\\'ve been really cool like in Ori\\n\\nThat\\'s just some points I think, but this game for sure it\\'s one of the shining star of this year.

The plot is not obscure, with a simple and immersive story that makes it easy for any player to understand the game's going. The excellent level of design and distinctive boss fights add to the experience. I personally found the game to be relatively easy to play, and the adjustable difficulty makes it easy for all types of gamers to get the hang of it.\\n\\nThe game is not yet completed all the development, so players will inevitably be forced to stop playing when they are in the middle of the game. There are various shortcomings in the game, including but not limited to: the lack of recognizable scene design, the small font size of the character dialogs, the linear flow of the game, and the inability to go back through levels. Overall, the game still has a lot of room for improvement and I'm looking forward to it getting better and better.\\n\\nI don't need to tell you how good SANABI is again, but since the game is not yet complete, it's a good idea for those who want to experience the full game to either buy it first or wait and see. However, since the game is still in its early access stage, you may want to wait for the full game release or support the developers by buying it now.

They make a Grappling Hook not only one of the most fun ways to traverse any environment but also a deadly weapon that stops enemies in their tracks as long as you are accurate enough to hit your target. This game is really ENTIRELY skill based because of its elegantly simple combat mechanic. Simple to understand but difficult and satisfying to master (at least for me on my XBox controller) \\n\\nIt has a familiar cyberpunk aesthetic but comes at the cyberpunk genre from a different perspective. You can see the normal Cyber Punk Archetypes but because the story and the world have so much character they feel fresh along with the world.\\n\\nThe music is intense and makes you feel like everything you are doing is the most important thing in the world. It compliments the moment to moment game play in a way that half the time you feel like you are a Master  one moment and the next moment scrambling to keep up with the pace. \\n\\nThis game isn't open world but every minute you are playing the game the world still feels deeper, and even though the point of the game is to explore an abandoned city the city still feels more alive then most open world games. \\n\\nAnd then there'ss the STORY, I didn't think I was going to get this into the narrative. Your main character has depth in a 2D Game just based on their actions, how they handle loss, their motives and what scares them. All while giving off this Batman Vibe. The story is a mystery that you unravel with each passing minute and there are actual moments in this where I was literally gasping with shock. The pacing of the game just keeps making you want to learn more and get better at the mechanics so you can explore more\\n\\nIn this game the story and the world are directly tied so by discovering more about the story you are effectively exploring this world. The Screenplay is top notch and understands that every character to stand out CANNOT sound/feel the same and when our characters meet others that have personalities that clash it actually pushes the story forward instead of just being a cute moment. \\n\\nThis game takes the 2D Platformer Genre and kicked down all the barriers that would make it feel flat or without depth. Cyberpunk 2077 could only hope to have the kind of seemingly effortless story telling chops this game has.\\n\\nAnd then you have the PIXEL ART.

Buy this game! \\n\\nPros:\\n- Good Music \\n- Great Art \\n- Fluid Movement - some of the best of any platformer i've played \\n- Interesting (enough) Combat \\n- A story which was fine in the beginning, but really hooked me into the building story-arc by the time i reached the end - it left me wanting more in a good way. Lots to look forward to as more content is added to the game!!!\\n- 2 good bossfights \\n- inclusion of a speedrun mode is really nice, for those who want *everything* timed. and getting rid of cutscenes for future playthroughs\\n- the protagonist has real motives and, despite his somewhat limited dialogue, acts like a fairly real person. written concisely i think would be a good term \\n- the deuteragonist was a little annoying at first, but definitely grew on me\\n- there was a really really cool moment towards the end of the currently playable content, i won't spoil it but i made me jump a little lol \\n\\nCons: \\n- 1 bad bossfight. middle child is always neglected, i guess? it's not really *offensively* bad, just not nearly as good as the other two. \\n- Some of the stage gimmicks are too easy \\n- the higher difficulties don't change the game enough, they just make you health progressively lower. in retrospect i could've even put the game on the highest difficulty (where you have 1 hp) and only really struggled with a handful of platforming sections, and one of the bosses in particular\\n- there's only one save slot atm\\n- this means in order to play the timed portions of the tutorial you need to erase current progress ( a way to access these in the main menu maybe?)\\n- some of the signs and notes in cutscenes are untranslated from korean (as this is a brand new korean indie studio, i give them a lot of slack in this department, the english TL of the story is better than a lot of native-english game writing these days)\\n- some of the audio settings are too loud by default, even with my system audio being pretty quiet, and some of the audio effects are disproportionately tuned (footsteps on a steel floor in a cutscene being louder than some of the gunshots right after). not a massive deal though, only broke my immersion once at the very beginning, and after i tuned audio sliders all was well.\\n\\nOverall i'd say the majority of my Cons are nitpicks, and i purposefully kept a lot of what i *couldve* praised in the Pros concise or absent so as to not spoil some of the great fun in this game. \\n\\nVery very much looking forward to what the team at WONDER POTION do with this project next!\",\n",

If you have ever mastered games in the past like Sonic The Hedgehog for the Genesis, you will feel a lot of satisfaction as you quickly progress through each stage section and master the simple to learn, but hard to master grappling hook mechanic. The grappling hook is the main mechanic and focus in Sanabi. As you get better at the controls the more freedom you will have while traversing the stages which is extremely satisfying.\\n\\nIf you love older platformers like Sonic and Mario this is a must play for you.

       " \"An outstanding experience. Rarely do I go on about a game without talking a bit of smack for fun beforehand, but I cannot with SANABI. I just completed the EARLY ACCESS on it's hardest difficulty (Die from one hit) thinking I could handle it. And while I did make it through, it was harder than even Katana Zero.\\n\\nGameplay - 10/10. This game not only plays smoothly, especially when you get a hang of it, but it makes you look cool while doing so. Maybe it's my appeal towards hookshots but man oh man, was it fun. Platformers are generally not my thing, but SANABI is a whole new level that allows you to move in ways most platformers wouldn't and in an intuitive manner. Though some of the bosses (JUSTICE) were extremely difficult, the frustration never fully seeped in cause of the learning experience behind it.\\n\\nStory - 8/10 - I cannot fully evaluate the story to be fair, cause the reality is, it's not finished quite yet. But the story is entertaining. Maybe it's cause I voice acted over the characters speaking, but it brought in intensity. The characters were likable to say the least. Honestly, if they need a voice actor, I hope I can be the one who does it for the main (Unnamed?) character. (I legitimately voice acted the whole game for each character too) The game provides charm and a bit of something else to it that really brings out the environment. One thing I will state for the benefit of the developer though.\\n(THERE ARE SOME GRAMMATICAL ERRORS! I WISH I SAVED A SCREEN SHOT OF EACH ONE! I APOLOGIZE! THERE WERE ABOUT 3!)\\n\\nGraphics/Art Style - 10/10 - This one's a bit of a tricky situation. Maybe it's my appeal to pixel art, but the animations really emphasize on making the game feel what it is. As mentioned before, the game play makes you look cool, but the animations themselves are part of the reason why. From flipping into the air, to landing on a wall in specific ways. This game provides a lot and puts heart into it that I cannot deny.\\n\\nMusic - 6/10 - Maybe it's because I'm picky as a musician, but the music didn't exactly WOW me compared to everything else in the game. It wasn't bad, just not mind blowing. Though I will say this much, it did it's job well. It provided to each environment in the correct tone. Though, there was a bit to be desired from it.\\n\\nOverall - 10/10 - While I may dismiss some aspects of the game, I'm not going to just deteriorate my overall score. The game play more than satisfied what I've wanted out of a game in a long time. It provided a challenge that was fabulous and an intensity that most games don't in this day and age. A fantastic game that I cannot wait to finish in the future.\",\n",

       " '(I played the full game now; I\\'m changing this review to positive and will write more details later. The rest of the message is the old review)\\n\\n-----\\n\\n(Keep in mind this review was written back in Early Access; I still need to revisit the game to give it a more fair rating and review)\\n\\nI can\\'t, with a light conscience, recommend this game as it is right now, as much as I want to.\\nKeep in mind that the game is in early access, and a lot of what I\\'ll be saying might change for the better; this is exactly why I\\'m writing this review.\\n\\nFirst, let\\'s start with the negatives:\\n(-) The cutscenes and dialogues are too frequent, and break the pacing of the game quite a lot. There are dozens of very long cutscenes, many of which don\\'t seem to be necessary.\\n(-) The dialogues have several problems; even in the intro sequence, it\\'s possible to spot moments where text boxes don\\'t seem to match the context, or dialogues don\\'t make sense, at least in English.\\n(-) The translation is incorrect or inaccurate, which adds to the dialogue being bad.\\n(-) The dialogue goes TOO FAST during action sequences. I think dialogue during action sequences is great, but having it be unreadable is just frustrating and not fun; I had to pause during my playthrough during these dialogues, when I cared about it.\\n(-) The story is intriguing, which makes this all the more frustrating; you really want to take the game seriously, but these problems make it so that it\\'s hard to.\\n(-) The game doesn\\'t really explain to you about clockwise and counter-clockwise movement with the dash. Although players will eventually figure it out, I think with the amount of tutorials, the game could have told me that as well.\\n(-) There was some untranslated Korean text in a few cutscenes. It\\'s understandable with the scenery, but I think it would do good just to have some subtitles, you know?\\n(-) Some areas seem very empty or incomplete, bland, with nothing new. I think these would be a good opportunity for the game to put some of the exceeding dialogue, instead of cramming all of it into a million cutscenes. Namely, I can see the \"plan\" sequences working out during these more empty parts.\\n(-) There were some opportunities lost with gameplay. I think this would be a perfect game to play with more momentum mechanics and bunny hopping. Making that easier and accessible for the player would be a good idea. Instead, touching the ground while attached to a hook just makes you lose all momentum. Also, retracting to your hook does not make you keep your speed when you cancel the retraction, and I think that\\'s a big lost opportunity.\\n(-) The parts with throwing the enemies into the laser just felt a lot more boring than the idea sounded like.\\n(-) There are no secrets and no real hidden easter eggs or anything like that. At least none that I could find. I feel like this game would greatly benefit from having several collectibles and hidden areas, to explore everything you can do with the tech of the hook.\\n( ? ) This might be just me, but I didn\\'t understand health and checkpoints very well. I\\'ve finished the game in about 3 hours or so, on hard mode, and had about 2 or 3 deaths; but I thought I was supposed to die after 2 hits? It semeed like I had 4 health instead, despite playing on \"hard\", where I was supposed to die in 2 hits.\\n\\nNow let\\'s talk about the good points:\\n(+) The gameplay is fluid and satisfying; it\\'s a character that is \"fun to play as\". The hook movement just works, and having a game based solely on that is a good plus.\\n(+) The artstyle is beautiful; it reminds me of Katana Zero a lot. There is even a Katana Zero reference inside the game (time samurai, lmao)\\n(+) Add this to having several animations for the characters. Characters have many different poses and expressions, and it seems like it never ends. Specially, Mari and the Daughter were really adorable during the cutscenes.\\n(+) The screen transitions feel smooth! I like that a lot in the game.\\n(+) It has a good sense of humor in the dialogue. I feel like some jokes drag on for too long, but in general, it\\'s likeable and I did laugh a few times.\\n(+) The music is good! Not phenomenal, but it was nice to listen to.\\n(+) The story is intriguing, and it did make me a bit emotional. Although the beginning is so positive and wholesome, that you know exactly what\\'s going to happen after.\\n\\n\\nOverall, this game needs little to be an amazing game, but it\\'s important to let devs know about the problems with it.\\nAs the game keeps getting updated, I\\'ll keep playing it, and I\\'ll update my review when I can and when I think the game is in a better state.\\n\\nIf you want to try it out yourself to see what I\\'m talking about, and perhaps just feel that sick gameplay, I do recommend the game; I just can\\'t tell anyone to try playing this game for a fun and enjoyable experience.',\n",
       " '[b]Katana ZERO + Spider-Man = Sanabi[/b]\\n\\nPlays [i]GREAT[/i] on Steam Deck, after 2 hours at time of review I had zero issues with the game; despite the warning that it sometimes shows MKB controls I had no such problems.

It\\'s weird, it doesn\\'t fix regardless of resolution setting, but it doesn\\'t bug me as much as it might bug other people. The fact I can\\'t remove the version number from the top left of the screen bugs me more than the letterbox resolution issue. \\n\\nOverall, it\\'s a great time and I\\'m having a lot of fun with it, it\\'s honestly the sole reason I dislike Early Access games: I know I\\'m going to reach the end of the content and have to wait for more without getting the whole game and the story I\\'m so far very invested in.\\n\\n** Edited Review Below **\\n\\nAs of 10/08/23 I\\'ve now played a near total 6 hours of the game and completed all the EA content. I need more, I want more. Hopefully I don\\'t have to wait too long for the finished product but as of right now it\\'s a fun game with minimal combat, decent story, fun characters. You could probably speedrun the content in an hour, the story itself is probably 4-5 hours itself as long as you don\\'t die often, which admittedly I did.\\n\\nNo glitches, no bugs, the game says use MKB but again, zero issues on Steam Deck. The control map in the settings does show MKB controls which is probably where the Steam Deck verification \"Playable\" label comes from, but I made no adjustments to the settings.\\n\\nFull recommendation, if you liked Katana Zero and/or grappling hook/swinigng mechanics this is the easiest recommendation of my life.',\n",

       " \"Though I've only played for around 2 hours, I've gone through the entire game. There is a good amount of content here for what it is and more to come. Clearly inspired by Katana Zero, this game focuses much harder on the movement aspect of these games to great effect. Highly recommend the pick up if you are looking for something similar. \\n\\nThere are some complaints I have though, the main one being polish. While this game looks and plays great, there are some things that become apparent when you start playing. The settings don't reset when reloading the game. Some of the grammar in the dialog is messed up, probably an easy fix. Your grappling hook reel-in is tied to the up arrow, however if you put jump on the up arrow as I do in my platformers, it can cause some annoying movement, reeling in when you meant to jump and continue your momentum. Also speed-run mode, probably what will be the main draw for games like this, still displays cutscenes and dialog and can even bug out to the point of turning the screen completely black. This is early access though and I expect that these bugs and features will be ironed out for the final release.\\n\\nAs for the rest of it? Movement is smooth and flowing when the level allows for it, you can get REALLY fast here. Some of the levels are worse than others, requiring you to stop and wait for something before continuing on. Mostly a personal gripe, I like flowing and continuous movement in my games. And the OST, it slaps. Where can I find this music, I need it.\\n\\nOverall: 7/10 Very solid platformer with a good story and crisp movement. Some things need tuning but when the game is released, I suspect this will be an 8-9/10. Easily worth the money.\",\n",
       " \"First and foremost, I need to say if you are somebody who has played purely from the demo and just picked up wherever your save file left off at, I strongly encourage you to scrap it and restart. There were a variety of wonderful touch ups and additions added to the beginning which, while not essential to view, are fun and can add nicely to some subtle moments. And who are we kidding this game is succinct and lovely to play through any number of times for the movement alone. Now to the actual review:\\n\\n\\nI have been invested in this game prior to its release, having played on the original demo available and the betas available at the given time, the game even then was passionate and filled with heart that greatly excited me for its final release. To my surprise, when it did actually release I already had access to the game, presuming it was an error or a final demo update I played through immediately.\\n\\nMuch to my surprise I had received the full game for free, at this point I'm still not sure if this was an error due to me having the demo and beta in my library or intentional on the developers part for the final release. This aside, I seldom feel obligated to comment on anything, but I was genuinely taken aback by this game having been granted the chance to play through it fully completed now. \\n\\nThe art and style was phenomenal and only grew stronger beyond the already released demo section. The integration of mechanics was tied nicely often with story beats and transitioned seamlessly into teaching applications of the mechanics directly in the platforming promoting alternate methods of using some of them. The platforming also encouraged creative problem solving for those looking for more unconventional solutions or speed running advantages. I'm avoiding talking on the story as it is incredibly well done for the tale it wishes to tell, and I am no one to spoil that. What I will say on it is that it is well structured in the sense the player is only as aware as they choose to be; which I think perfectly builds into the aesthetic and narrative itself. The games story delivers where it matters most, being heartfelt, meaningful, and while not getting so broad as to water down its core story. All in all, I loved this game, it vindicates the player and makes actions feel worth it even more so by that ending.\\n\\nFor nitpicks, most of my issues are realistically non-issues, and more so quality of life gripes(3).\\n-In the English translation specifically there are a variety of grammatical errors, however none are overly detrimental to the moment or the overall understanding of what's going on. \\n-There are a few issues in terms of optimization at this current point, the amount of assets present seems to be delaying the rate of level loading times which can lead to longer black screen load times. While load screens aren't entirely a bad thing, these also apply to falling off the map in which your speed run timer will keep running, which presents some issues.. \\n-The last is a more specific issue for those who played the demo. If you had a save file that had unlocked Legendary at that time period and was using it, upon beginning the full game from where you left off you were locked to that state and unable to change due to Legendary being an unlock feature, which required a full game restart to be able to change it. Given how this would be difficult to adjust I understand how this came to be a bug and may be helpful to simply make a toggle if the game reads the save as having that setting enabled prior to the unlock to allow for the player to adjust down to an appropriate play level to still earn the Legendary mode.\\n\\nTLDR; Game good, very pretty, heartfelt story, chain arm go zoom, and actually play from beginning. I wish the team the best, thank you for your wonderful game.\",\n",

       " '[h1]SANNABI The Revenant[/h1]\\n\\nLet the anguish take control and swing for the fences. SANNABI The Revenant launches you over, under, and across the dystopian future with an agonizing vengeance. I’ve really fallen in love with the platformers recently published by Neowiz, such as Metal Unit and Skul: The Hero Slayer, which I had the pleasure to review. So when I caught wind of this project, developed by Wonder Potion, my heart leapt with anticipation. I had no idea what I was getting myself into.\\n\\nYou are a retired veteran soldier, who has gone away from the violence to a quiet life with your young daughter. Being a father is amazing, and the memories you create with your daughter are priceless. Life is bliss. Until you get a visit out of nowhere from someone in your past… who brings a pain that will soon become your driving force.\\n\\nSANNABI is a 2D action-platformer, but not like any other I remember playing. So far, in this demo version of the game, the enemies aren’t actually your main concern, the environment is. Not with spewing balls of lava or with bodies of water to drown in, but just by being itself. Sure, there are a few enemies here and there that you need to take care of, but I found myself being killed by the landscape I was trying to latch onto (or land on) more often than not.\\n\\nThis introduces the most difficult aspect of the game for me: the platforming is done mostly by swinging. Your chain-hook prosthetic arm gives you the ability to latch on to most of the surfaces from a distance, so you’ll use it to literally fly across the screen. Some of the objects you latch onto will let you redirect yourself off of them, giving it a controllable pinball feel.\\n\\nSwinging from one platform to the next sounds serene and calming, right? Not in SANNABI. This game takes the concept, represented in my mind most by a friendly neighborhood kid in a red and blue jumpsuit, and smashes it into a mixer with bolts of body-jolting electricity and break-neck speed. Which is where the difficulty comes in. Most times I was swinging so fast I had hardly enough (if any at all) time to react and shoot my chain-hook at the next ledge. And if that wasn’t difficult enough, some of the surfaces are too sheer to grab onto, or even electrocuted. Partner this with insta-deaths when touching electricity, and a very low threshold to take damage from enemies, and this is one of the more difficult games to get the hang of in recent memory.\\n\\nSANNABI takes place in MAGO. The city of MAGO is a dark, neon-lit technological metropolis set in a retro graphics aesthetic. From what you recall, the city was run by a criminal faction when you were an active soldier. in the time I spent on this game, I felt enveloped by the dark atmosphere, like a vigilante launching myself over buildings in a permanent nightfall. The music was very “cyber-esque” and set the perfect backdrop to the stage.\\n\\nSANNABI was a really fun experience. This small taste of the story has me excitedly anticipating the full release of the game. However, the action and mechanics applied were extremely difficult to wrap my fingers around. I’ve never been good with fast paced games on the keyboard, because my fingers usually move off of the keys due to excitement. This problem came out in full force as I played through this demo. The ability to play with a controller is there, but it only made things even more difficult. It uses the same controls to move your character as it does to aim your chain-arm. The option to customize the configuration would make the experience a million times better. This being considered, though, I still really enjoyed this experience, and look forward to more. I’m hyped to swing for the fences in the full game.',\n",

       " 'The game\\'s story goes from 0 to 100, really fucking fast, and and it\\'s the highlight of the game, by far. Characters are interesting, and it does have some funny moments here and there for what I would describe overall as a pretty dark and dystopian atmosphere. The mystery that\\'s going on isn\\'t cut and dry, so you\\'re kept guessing what\\'s going on. The only \"twist\" that you could see coming from a mile away is essentially having to go through this game\\'s version of the Mines of Moria. Only small nitpicks are that the game does have a few small typos here and there, and some world building gets left out. One example being when the main characters mention that the government says some research is banned and illegal, and I\\'m sitting here wondering, \"Why is it illegal? Was there some event that led to it being made illegal?\" But again, nitpicks.\\n\\nMy only gripes are that the main mechanic of the grappling arm doesn\\'t control very well in some places, the platforming can be really tight in some areas, and it makes it difficult to tell how you\\'re supposed to progress through some areas, as in, \"where am I supposed to go? I can\\'t see anything on the screen to latch onto\". For context, I\\'m playing with a controller here, so maybe it\\'s less finicky with a keyboard and mouse? Additionally, there are times that it feels like the invincibility frames after getting hit are way too short, and I get that it\\'s meant as a recovery mechanic, but when some random platform goes into a danger zone, you\\'re knocked off, and some bullet randomly hits you and you get hit again by the danger zone...it gets kind of tiresome. I will say, I wish there was a type of general purpose dodge sometimes, that doesn\\'t involve getting hit.\\n\\nCombat\\'s pretty decent, the normal mooks aren\\'t too much trouble and it\\'s insanely fun to zip around the map killing enemies. That is, until this one enemy starts showing up partway through chapter 2, and turns some fights into less of a combat encounter, and more of a puzzle fight, and not in a good way. Having to maneuver enemies into certain positions gets really annoying, but outside of that section, that particular enemy did not reappear in chapter 3, which is the furthest you can go at the time of review.\\n\\nBoss fights on the other hand are much more entertaining, with a few small hiccups here and there for some fights. The only downside I can say is that there\\'s no checkpoint system for any of them, so if you die at any point, you\\'re starting at the beginning of the fight once again. It\\'s a pro for some people, a con for others. It\\'s not that bad for the first boss since it\\'s not the longest boss fight in the world, but it becomes a pain for the second, especially considering how many times you need to knock them down, and the \"process\" to knock them down...\\n\\nOverall, the game\\'s pretty entertaining for what\\'s there, and I\\'m pretty invested into the story at this point, so I\\'m really interested to see where it goes.',\n",

This game's highs are jubilant, featuring some of the most freeing movement in a 2D platformer and a story that subverts one's expectations in a way that feels earned and powerful rather than a cheap plot point like many lesser stories.\\nInversely, however, this game inspired such frustration within me that I had not previously thought possible, with the game's targeting system with the hook and the late-game charging move. (I am aware that there is a setting for aim-assist for the hook, but I had problems both with it on and off.) I also encountered several bugs during the final boss fight in which the boss would freeze in an idle pose with full invincibility. (In hindsight, I believe this was caused by resetting to last checkpoint on the frame she was transitioning from or to a move) This game was also originally written in Korean, as while it is very well localized, the translation itself features some minor errors and, more importantly, many vague sentences that make it unclear what exactly is happening.\\nThis game has undeniable faults, but I still recommend it to anyone who enjoys intense 2D platformers or, thanks to the game's many difficulty options, anyone who would be interested by a heartstrings-pulling story. I would also highly recommend playing on keyboard and mouse, as despite the unwieldy keybindings, you may edit them as you choose and aiming the hook is significantly more satisfying. \\n...Yeah, I think that about covers it.\",\n",

There was much more story than I was expecting, with probably 1/4 of the time playing being plot-driven/narrative-based. While I wish there was less story than this, that's mainly because of how the main gameplay works - as I said, it's fast-paced and the movement feels super smooth, so it can be a bit jarring to go from that to a discussion between characters. Ultimately, I think the devs delivered this juxtaposition as well as they could with an engaging storyline to boot. Aside from that, the only other thing I wish was different is that in some areas, hitting terrain that hurts you (primarily areas with red lasers), you can easily get stun-locked into dying. It's not a big deal given save points are frequent, but there were several times I hit a laser and knew I would have to wait for it to hit me three more times so I could die and start over instead of having the chance to reposition myself (which would be more skill-expressive, IMO) and carry on.\\n\\nSANABI has a little bit of everything going for it - action, adventure, platforming, combat, a relevant storyline, and a fantastic soundtrack to accompany it all.

I grabbed it on a small sale and saw a lot of the reviews praising this game and saying it is similar to Katana Zero, another great game I love. Upon finishing Sanabi, I have to say, this is one of the best 2D action games I have played. I feel like it is Katana Zero meets Celeste. Let\\'s dig in.\\n\\nYou play as a retired General who is spending time with his lovely daughter. While living the good life and using your awesome grapple hook arm, your daughter heads inside your home and sees a clock with the name \"Sanabi\" on it. Before the General can warn her, she dies in the explosion. Days have passed, the General now wants to hunt Sanabi for the death of his daughter. He takes on a mission to enter a city where are the humans have mysteriously vanished. All, but one. A woman has sent a distress signal from inside the city. Your mission is to figure out why all the humans have disappeared from the city and to get the woman out of there alive.\\n\\nSanabi is a 2D action platformer. The controls are tight and very fun to get used to. As the General, you will be jumping and grappling onto walls, platforms, and more as you traverse the city to complete your mission. I felt like I was playing Celeste but with a grappling hook as the levels got more and more complex. Everything is very simple to master and as you progress, you will learn one to two more skills that enhance the gameplay.\\n\\nThe pixel graphics are gorgeous as well as the music. I was bobbing my head to the great soundtrack as I was swinging across chasms and fighting enemies. The boss fights were very fun and memorable. However, gameplay aside, Sanabi\\'s strongest asset was its story. While playing, I kept thinking I had the story down, and then curveball after curveball hit me until I got to the good ending (which was so EFFIN good!!!).\\n\\nHowever, this game does have its flaws. While the story is very strong and beautiful, it also hinders the game as well. You know how Metal Gear Solid is a great game but it has long cut scenes? Sanabi has that same issue as there will be times you will be sitting through long scenes in between gameplay that will just break the flow. While these scenes are skippable, you really need to watch them to fully immerse yourself into the story. Some of the later levels really hit you with a skill check and may take a while to beat. I also had a bug here and there where my jump button was also tied to my grapple button, but a quick reset on the controls fixed this issue whenever it occurred. There were times when I got stuck in walls or laser grids that got me some cheap deaths, but nothing game-breaking.\\n\\nFinal verdict? This game has definitely planted itself into my top 10 games. I tried to keep my review short and sweet because I don\\'t want to spoil anything, but I just have to say, the scenes leading up to the end of the game literally had me in tears. I legit sobbed at the end of the game and I am so grateful I played it to the very end. The characters were great, the story was amazing, and the gameplay and boss fights were top-notch. This was a perfect indie game and I highly HIGHLY recommend you play this masterpiece. The story will slow you down and there may be a bug here or there, but the overall experience was just perfect and I praise the developers for a wonderful journey. Thank you for reading.\\n\\nPS: \"Getting to the End is not what\\'s important......\"',\n",

This wouldn't be terrible if it wasn't for some rather tough sections that can lead to a lot of back to back deaths. The audio pausing was probably the most grating aspect tbh since you have this bombastic music playing then it stops for 5 seconds and then it comes back. When this is happening constantly it gets annoying. You may only experience this if you try playing on a higher difficulty like I did. \\n-I experienced some bugs where I was stuck to a wall and had to finagle a bit to get unstuck. There was even a time I glitched through a wall entirely and had to restart at a prior checkpoint to fix. Hopefully the devs can patch this out. \\n-No d-pad control when swinging. \\n\\nDespite all my criticisms this was a very unique and memorable game that I would like to return to at some point.

Indeed, it wasn\\'t...\\n\\nI purchased Sanabi during early access without knowing anything about the game, and I was waiting for its full release since then to make this review. Buying this game was one of the best decisions I have ever made because Sanabi was, without a doubt, one of the best gaming experiences of my life...\\nI never thought the story of Sanabi would be this intriguing and absorbing. It\\'s a must-play for anyone who enjoys action and deep story games. I would genuinely like to volunteer for the games Turkish language support if I could as a Turkish player because more people need to know about a game like this...\\nExcellent story and gameplay.\\n10/10',\n",
       " 'this is a really good game with an amazing story',\n",
       " 'A game I REALLY want to like but the more I think back on my time the more I feel like there is a huge wealth of missed potential.\\n\\nThis game demands both speed and precision, however there are numerous pitfalls (metaphorically and VERY literally) that hinder the overall experience. This is almost exclusively because of level design. There is almost always an instant-death pit beneath you, meaning that one minuscule mistake will cause you to restart however you are encouraged to go as fast as you can due to the many timed puzzles and pursuant enemies driving your forward. You can become stunlocked and die with no way to recover and the sheer amount of information you need to be processing in the later levels is nothing short of insane. It\\'s like you\\'re expected to fail just so you can see what\\'s coming up ahead. Once you know what you\\'re meant to be dealing with the game becomes much easier to enjoy as you can actually plan your next moves. As a result I feel like this game would benefit strongly from a slow-down mechanic. Maybe it can be tied to certain actions you perform or simply a button toggle but if I could have had even a second to take a breath and assess my surroundings my frustrations would have almost completely vanished.\\n\\nThe art in this game is beautiful, the music is fantastic and the characters are engaging (although the story does beat you over the head for way longer than it should about certain plot points). When the level design allows it you can really fly through the city and simply enjoy traversal. Heck, even the combat is fun for how sparse it is.\\n\\nHowever there is a specific boss \"fight\" that goes on for FAR too long. It was such a long encounter that there are multiple checkpoints IN the encounter itself, and the difficulty of what you\\'re supposed to do isn\\'t consistent. Some \"cycles\" are nigh-impossible to do in time without knowing what you\\'re dealing with ahead of time while others are so easy you could do them in a wheelchair. And this sporadic difficulty is all over the game, there\\'s no real sense of difficulty progression because the problem is often \"you don\\'t know what\\'s ahead? Better die and figure it out on your second try\". And then when you DO get ahead you have to repeat the process allllllll over again.\\n\\nI think the best way of summarising my feelings is this:\\nInstead of \"cyber Spider-man\" I got \"trial and error: the reckoning\".\\n\\nThere is a good game here, it just wasn\\'t hitting the right notes for me. Too many issues were compounding on one another and the only thing keeping me engaged was the story and character interaction. Despite my frustrations I\\'d say there\\'s more to enjoy than dislike here, even though it seems like I\\'ve done nothing but rant endlessly.',\n",

       " 'So, I\\'m not quite done yet, but I felt the need to write a review for this one before I finish it up.\\n\\nThis game is a beautifully paced tide of intensity, starting with a simple layer of movement, and then the mechanics start packing on and punching in to make the pace frantic, the combat hectic, and the overall result a pulse-boosting, emotionally captivating experience. Soundtrack is absolutely bonkers level of tasty synthwave/electronic goodness. EXTREMELY high quality. The pixel art and general spectacle of the game are fantastic. Writing somehow manages to balance grittiness and some level of comic relief without feeling forced or having any \"Well THAT just happened\" moments. The highs are high and might give you a chuckle, and the lows will hit ya right in the gut.\\n\\nLevel design is generally great, with a few small sections that I found a little irritating, but were eventually passed with relative ease on the normal difficulty once I took a moment to step back and put on a momentary cap of thinking for five seconds and actually controlling my movement. Certain sections have a bit of a learning curve, so some levels will rack up the death counter, but if you really dig into the movement mechanics you mechanically feel like a dang superhero by the last few sections of the game. \\n\\nMy best recommendation without spoiling anything is, when you are given the option to rerun the tutorial, do it a handful of times, mess around with the movement, get a feel for the speed and what directional inputs do while you\\'re swinging. I ran the tutorial around 5 or 6 times because it\\'s less than a minute long and I genuinely feel like it enriched my experience with the game.\\n\\nIt\\'s also consistently adding in new little mechanics to make sure that movement never goes stale and ensuring that they tie into that delicious, delicious worldbuilding.\\n\\nThere are difficulty settings across the board from \"You have infinite health and can only die in pits/instant kills, enjoy the story\" to \"A single fart from an enemy kills you\". Also has a speedrun mode that you unlock, presumably after beating the game once. If I had to guess it\\'s probably the levels and bosses in rapid sequence with cutscenes removed.\\n\\nGame is positively dank. As I said, not quite done yet but I\\'m really, REALLY enjoying it.

Being able to dash after being hit is a nice recovery option and I can't wait to see how speedrunners abuse this tactic. You can go really fast in this game and swinging around felt fun, though I hope to see a little more enemy variety in the full version. The final boss was definitely the biggest highlight of the game for me. All of the other bosses were great as well but I felt this one definitely will test your grappling skills the most.\\n\\nThe story and characters were nicely written. The story goes from seemingly cheerful to dark pretty fast and early on. I like the concept of the world, with it being some sort of cyberpunk Korean setting with shadowy corporate conspiracies. The characters have enough charm to keep things from being overly mopey, and the game throws in cute references and doesn't take itself too seriously but manages to keep you invested in what's going on. The character designs were also good. One of my favorites was the Gun Head boss encountered at the beginning of the game. The look of the city is fantastic, though I wish there was a little more variety in terms of level aesthetic.\\n\\nAs someone who is eager for the Katana Zero dlc I feel this game was able to scratch that itch while also being able to retain a distinct identity on its own.

You play as the retired army general on the path of vengeance. Attached to your shoulder is the Chain Arm - part weapon, part grappling hook that you use to not only swing around the dystopian cyberpunk streets of Mago city, set in Korea. The Chain Arm is also used to...\\n\\n*checks notes*\\n\\n...rip enemies apart in an instant.\\n\\nThis is a one-hit kill platformer that makes you feel powerful when you pull off a sick move, and like an absolute loser when you whiff it. Speedrunners rejoice - this is the one you're looking for. There are various tools to traverse the environment, boosting through swings with your Chain Arm at the right moment will propel you to the next area in a single swift move. Memorizing the environment will make it even easier to chain your movement from zone to zone quickly.\\n\\nWhich is a bit of a shame because...the environment is beautiful. Mago city is full of neon lights, industrial corridors, and beautifully-designed robots both friend and foe. The game gives massive Katana ZERO vibes, with the fast-paced nature of Super Meat Boy and similar wall-jumping platformers in the genre - all wrapped up in tasty cyberpunk vibes.\\n\\nThere are some minor graphical issues in some of the cinematics, and there were TINY but noticible performance issues I while playing. But this review was made literally hours after the game's early access release so there's still time to tune these things up.\\n\\nI have a lot to play and experience in Sanabi so far, but if you're a fan of fast-paced platformers like Katana ZERO and Super Meat Boy then you're really going to like this one.\",\n",

       " 'Sanabi is as satisfying to play as it looks, boldly making another case for the ol\\' question: \"Does a grappling hook make every game better?\". In the case of this cyberpunk platformer, the answer is yes. Drawing heavy visual and storytelling inspiration from the fantastic Katana: Zero, Sanabi is a story about transhumanism, capitalism, trauma, and family. While in some cases the anti-capitalist nature of the story comes off as ham-fisted especially as it conflicts with its seemingly pro-militarist narrative, the game is at all times tongue-in-cheek with it\\'s delivery of this message (there is a painting of Elon Musk in one of the levels). Aside from thematic criticism, the writing in Sanabi is occasionally muddied by what is clearly haphazard translation from Korean to English, but this is a criticism specific to the English version and I can\\'t speak for other versions of the game. Overall I thought the writing was very good, with good dramatic and comedic timing, so this is more of a nitpick than anything. I highly recommend this game for people looking for a fast-paced platformer with a good story, good art, and satisfying movement mechanics.',\n",

Probably the most fluid and fun movement mechanics I've ever seen in a 2D platformer, amazing boss fights, incredible music, the pixel art is probably the best I've ever seen in a video game and the story is one of the most emotional and impactful I've ever experienced. Game was about 9 hours long for me on Hard difficulty and the quality stays high that whole time, there's no point where it drops off, which is insane given the quality of the animation in every scene.

The waiting paid off and the release is truly a wonderfully executed, finished game.\\n\\nAs great as the music, the art style and the combat is - I'm mostly happy that the developers stuck the landing on the campaign and delivered an amazing story that quite frankly is even better than Katana Zero's. It hit me in the feels like KZ didn't.\\n\\nA lot of comparisons with Katana Zero have been made - in a very positive sense ofc, but now having finished the game I can honestly say, that the comparisons should probably stop. Yes, the music and the art style is just as great, but apart from that Sanabi stands on its own. It has it's own unique gameplay, that is far closer to Celeste than Katana Zero. Traversing levels at 'high octane' speeds and killing enemies along the way has a very different feel compared to KZ. The boss fights are all unique and fun. The difficulty is even on Veteran mostly fair. There were one or two passages in Chapter 3 or 4 where the next checkpoint was a little bit too far away and you had to repeat 'a little bit' too much for my taste but otherwise it was a great experience. \\n\\nWhat is also interesting to note is, that the further you get in the campaign, the more abilities you unlock and the more fun (!) traversing levels actually becomes. I thought that was quite a feat, because usually the further you get in a game the more difficult and frustrating it simply gets - this is somewhat true for Sanabi as well, but trust me, you will have the best time in the game when you blast through the last chapter with all your abilities unlocked.  What a great finale and feeling, when you reach the ending!\\n\\nUh yeah, so.... recommended! In fact..a tie for Game of the Year for me (with BG3 and Dave the diver)\",\n",

But most of them share the same point:\\n\\nThat this game is phenomenal, in so, so many ways, and one that you shouldn’t miss. \\n\\nThe grapple hook is done extremely well here, and, with the other mechanics it introduces, makes you feel like a boss as you zip across the screen, killing enemies with crunchy sound effects and a badass soundtrack.\\n\\nThe story starts off pretty simple, but, at least for me, it was quite engaging (hey, maybe I don’t have taste, I don’t know). But as it unravels, there are twists that completely table the turns and a satisfying ending that blows your socks off and leaves you hungry for more (yeah, it’s satisfying, but as soon as it ended, I was like “that’s it?”). I heard that the developers were making DLC, which I hope is true, and really hope is coming soon. \\n\\nThe characters here are great too, and, throughout a game, you really do feel a connection to them. Mari serves as a great side character, adding humor to the game and strengthening its many serious moments. \\n\\nI do have a minor nitpick with this game, which is when you fall off a cliff or die. When you die, the music completely stops, it pauses for a few seconds, and then you start back at a checkpoint. It kills the flow of the game and I feel it would have been better if the game involved quicker deaths and allow you to get back into it faster (according to my memory, it did this for ONE BOSS FIGHT, and I frankly wish it did this for the whole game. I did do this on normal mode, and didn’t try it on legendary or other difficulties. The pause button also speeds things up a bit, although it still pause the music and you still have to wait).\\n\\nRegardless, this is just one small blemish on a masterfully crafted painting, and it beats out most 59.99 and now 69.99 games out there (for the sweet, sweet price of 14.99).\\n\\nSo just get it.',\n",

[spoiler] This was mainly in the overseer section[/spoiler]\\nVisuals: When moving at higher speeds it got a bit difficult to distinguish which surfaces you could hook on and which you couldn't. A similar issue also happened with background sections looking too much like they're in the foreground as well.\\nStory: [spoiler] The story seems pretty predictable with the main characters having a plan -> something goes wrong at the final step -> they use a different plan.

I was never truly lost on what was going on in the story, any more than the games narrative was intentionally pacing itself for. The pixel art in this game is just gorgeous. Each area has a distinct art style separating it from the last and SEVERAL screenshot worthy stills presented by the story.

It's almost a shame to put such a fun game mechanic in such a story-heavy game. \\nThere's a few moments of bad level design (some jumps that you need to make offscreen with little to no indicator that that's where you need to go) and the pacing really drags during the middle, but it has a rewarding ending so overall I'd say it's worth it. Whatever this studio does next I'll be checking out. \\nTL;DR this game spend half of its time ruling and the other half of the time playing like a visual novel, and both parts work well in a vacuum but together they tend to clash.

The gameplay revolves around your grappling hook arm, and features a lot of aerial movement. The game provides a decent challenge, and has incredibly fun and fluid movement that makes it feel good to go fast and pull off tricks, or just finish certain more difficult sections. The controls are responsive, and you can feel your momentum carry over in your movement without feeling too floaty. The combat in the game is an extension of the movement system, and fighting enemies furthers the momentum instead of bringing the gameplay to a halt. The pixel art is nothing short of beautiful, with several unique and cinematic locations and backgrounds. I will say, the English translation isn't perfect, and there are some lines that don't quite make sense and need to be read over more than once, but it was still very understandable and didn't really hamper my enjoyment of the story. I would absolutely recommend the game, especially if you like platformers, pixel art, and crying over said pixel art.\",\n",

There is plenty of foreshadowing and things that were carefully written to keep the world consistent and making sense even among the insanity of what the main character is going through. Granted there are a couple odd translation moments but no typos nor anything that will just pull you out of it and ruin the moment. Everything is always clear and easy to understand, just a couple oddities with the way the languages work such as not knowing which pronoun to use on a specific character. Simply put its amazing. From the tutorials playing with the character\\'s daughter the story is already digging its hooks into you and all the time its building up to the final grand reveal.

This game capitalizes on both, having some of the most fun combat AND platforming of any game I've ever played. How does it achieve this? The protagonist's signature chain arm and other movement abilities, beyond being cool as heck, give the player unrestricted freedom over exactly where they need to go, how fast they need to get there, whether they need invincibility frames when getting there, etc. Pretty much any mistake or screw-up in this game is entirely the player's fault, while every success is a result of the player's skill, and adds to the feeling of flow the game allows. There's no better feeling than being able to breeze through multiple checkpoints in a row without dying or falling out of the map. \\n\\nThe game offers different difficulty options for different people based on the experience they want (ex: I would imagine someone wanting to experience the story alone would probably pick Easy, where your character doesn't take damage, while people who want a challenging experience may pick Veteran(hard) or Legend(one HP)), so players have some level of control over their experience.  \\n\\nAs for the actual content in the game itself, the game is roughly 15 hours long with 5 levels. Each level has a different setting, platforming mechanics, BGM (this game has a really good soundtrack), and enemies. While different, all of these levels are fun and enable a player to achieve the flow state I was discussing earlier. The last level in particular is what I believe to be the best level I've ever played through in a video game in terms of mechanics, writing, and pure fun factor. Furthermore, there are a number of bosses spread throughout the game, all of which are fair, look pretty cool, and are a blast to fight. \\n\\nVisuals: well, you've seen the trailers. The game looks gorgeous, with a beautiful pixel-crafted world that encapsulates the futuristic city we all imagined in our heads. The game uses visuals well, never being too overbearing and never taking away from the gameplay while perfectly telling the story of the place you're in. Furthermore, animations are solid as well, making the protagonist look cool as the player platforms through these levels while ripping apart every enemy in sight. \\n\\nFor the game's plot, I won't say anything except that it's really good. The plot centers around two characters, and their interactions throughout the game made me smile, laugh, and tear up at different points throughout the game. If you like a story with well written characters, play this game.\\n\\nIt's a great game, and you should definitely play it, especially if you like action platformers like Katana ZERO.\",\n",

       " \"The Overwhelmingly Positive rating is well deserved. Originally, I was getting the impression this was a mid platformer with some nice graphics, but the game manages to stay fresh with each new area introducing one or two new mechanics which are combined well with previous ones. I would say you can tell by the 2nd area or so if this game is for you. I won't focus much on the positives here are my negatives:\\n\\n- The early story is sloooow. Not a slog, just slow, with more than a couple walking segments. I can see this would put off a lot of people from otherwise fast paced game unfortunately, but it only happens near the beginning.\\n\\n- The mystery of the story takes a while to start resolving, but by the time it does start, you kind of already know what the answers are going to be. Not to say it's unoriginal, but the themes have been tread before. That being said, I really like how this game's story plays out. I was interested all the way through to figure out what is going on. Some minor things are confusing at the end, and I spotted more than 1 plot hole, but it's nothing major.\\n\\n- There is a gauntlet at the end. The game has frequent saves so it's not a gameplay problem, but you're running through areas you've already been to, which is always annoying to me. Thankfully it is a lot faster this time around. That reminds me,\\n\\n- Levels are quite long some times. I finished in 9.8 hrs, and I played in one day in one sitting (because I really wanted to see how story pans out) so probably closer to 7 hours. On one hand, there is a lot of gameplay here, but at the same time a lot of that gameplay is the same mechanic throughout a level. It's not that the character is slow or anything either, the levels just start to drag at some point, especially Chapter 3 levels.\\n\\n- The boss near the end is annoyingly hard. I don't even know if I want to come back and do Legendary because of how annoying that boss was to fight.\\n\\nOverall, I will say the mystery and theme carries this game more than the gameplay. The gameplay is nice but I can easily see how it can feel padded or samey and boring. Unlike Katana Zero, if the game starts easy for you, it ends feeling just as easy. But if this isn't a deal breaker for you, it's a good game. Just a really well put together game with a really good story.\",\n",

Mechanics continued to evolve, boss fights were unique and exciting, mob diversity kept things interesting, and anything that initially felt redundant proved to have significant meaning later, which made me appreciate the game that much more.\\n\\nAll in all, this indie game surpassed my expectations by far, and out-shined many of the recent AAA game releases.

       " \"\\n[h3] Gameplay: [/h3] \\nThe combat in Sanabi is inspired by 'Katana Zero' -- with the most obvious change from its combat being the swing mechanic. Swinging around always feels satisfying when pulled off, and means that you are always moving and swinging throughout the levels that have been carefully designed for that movement, but can feel finicky at times especially since it is such an unconventional mechanic and takes a while to get used to. The difficulty is also trying to mirror that of 'Katana Zero' and scales exceedingly well as the game progresses and different enemy types and complications to the game are added a a pace that keeps the gameplay interesting while not becoming overwhelming. The controls also work well on both on controller and mouse and keyboard since it allows you to you your cursor to aim which is refreshing seeing as most 2D platfromers on PC have pretty mediocre controls. The game also has a harder unlockable difficulty and a speedrunner mode and due to its short length of 9 hours is replayable, but don't expect to be playing it over and over again since most of the main fluff of the game is in that first playthrough. The length of the game also means that it doesn't overstay its welcome and means that each enemy encounter feels meaningful and fun.\\n\\n[h3] Visuals: [/h3] \\n'Sanabi' has gorgeous visuals that mix real-time lighting and fog with beautiful pixel art that blends well with the fast-paced combat that needs that clear visual clarity. The game will constantly pan over vast beautiful cityscapes that set the atmosphere for the game and act as a moment of reflection in between the intense combat sections and are an absolute joy to look at. \\n\\n[h3] Story: [/h3] \\n Sanabi's story is a mystery thriller with a captivating and engaging story that leads to some genuinely jaw-dropping moments, but is tainted with annoying characters and a weak ending. I found the secondary main character 'Mari' pretty frustrating, with lines that are distracting in serious moments and unfunny in the calmer ones. It also does have different endings according to your choices but it isn't a big aspect of the game. Only one choice affects the ending, and one of the endings is essentially just a cutscene, which feels like a waste of an opportunity. The longer, more fleshed-out ending didn't click with me as much as I would have liked, and felt like it wasn't the ending the game had been building up to.\\n\\n[h3] Music: [/h3] \\nSanabi's music is excellent, having adrenaline-pumping tracks with boss tracks being especially exhilarating and more serene slower-paced tracks that stick in your head long after you've beaten the game.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Sanabi can stand as its own next to the games that inspired it such as Celeste, Katana Zero, and Hotline Miami through its exceptional music, gameplay, visuals, and story and should get more of the recognition it deserves.\",\n",

And fun.\\n\\nThe game's introduction of new mechanics are paced excellently; its core gameplay loop is enjoyable almost regardless of what level of the skill spectrum you land on; the story is intriguing in both themes and its beats, dropping just enough hints that a player is capable of solving its mysteries incredibly early while still remaining fuelled with a jet-fuel level of emotional oomph that'll keep the player pushing to the end.\\nIt's very, very good.\\n\\nThe only real criticism I have is on what is (technically) the final boss, whose mechanics are obscure in a way that encourages experimentation but tended to just leave me baffled. I'm still not sure why my shift would get blocked at some moments.\\nThat's literally my only criticism.

I was excited because I had written this game off as one doomed to never be updated again, liek so many others, but here it was.\\nI won't spoil any of the story because it's best experienced, but I will tell you, this is a high flying, swinging adventure through a doomed city... and that getting to the end isn't what's important... it's how you get there.\",\n",

       " \"An honest review of SANABI - \\n\\nSANABI is undeniably captivating, weaving a tale of intense gameplay and immersive storytelling. Although, there are some setbacks to it. \\n\\nGameplay and Visual Charm:\\nSANABI's gameplay is a thrilling escapade, offering a challenging platformer that has its difficulty with a lot excitement. The 2D pixel art style, reminiscent of Celeste, adds a nostalgic touch, creating a visually compelling environment. The *initial* playthrough is a delightful rollercoaster, with engaging mechanics that set it apart from other games.\\n\\nReplay Value:\\nWhile SANABI looks fun for another round, its charm begins to disappear upon replaying. The story really loses its charm, it's just not interesting after you know the ending, and the achievements, omg. The achievements that are left after completing the game are some of the hardest ones. \\n\\nChallenges and Achievements:\\nSANABI introduces a commendable level of difficulty, reaching its zenith in the formidable Legend mode. However, the pursuit of achievements becomes a double-edged sword as the overwhelming challenge, particularly in beating the game on Legend mode, can deter even the most determined players. The lofty difficulty may alienate those seeking a more laid-back gaming experience, impacting the game's accessibility.\\n\\nCutscene Overload:\\nA notable drawback lies in SANABI's reliance on cutscenes, disrupting the harmony between storytelling and gameplay. The engaging storyline is occasionally overshadowed by an almost 50/50 split between cutscenes and interactive play. This imbalance, disrupts the game's rhythm and could potentially remove the amount of overall enjoyment. \\n\\nTime:\\nIt's really a short game, sadly. It's only got about 8 hours worth of gameplay, and like I said, it's about half cutscenes. I really loved this game, but it only being 8 hours really deterred me from it. If it were lengthier, I'd definitely rate it better than I will soon.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nSANABI stands as a commendable piece of indie gaming, offering an enthralling platformer with a narrative that initially captivates. However, the overabundance of cutscenes and the super difficult achievements in the latter part of the game pose hurdles to its long-term appeal. Nonetheless, for those seeking an adrenaline-pumping and challenging gaming experience, especially during the initial joyride, SANABI remains a solid choice. It IS worth the cost, 100%, 8/10 game.\",\n",

       " \"I'm really on the fringe of recommending vs not recommending. The game was a 6~7 for me personally. It's a fast paced platformer with good pixel art and great gameplay. Controls are super responsive, levels are great and reward fast and aggressive play, soundtrack really stands out. It has some solid set pieces, and really ramps up tension for boss fights. Although the introduction was slow and boring, as soon as I got to the first real level, I thought this game might hold me over until Earthblade comes out. The thought ended about 20-30 minutes later.\\n\\nI do recommend this game on the gameplay and music alone. However, at least for me, it can't stand among the greats because of its presentation and writing.\\n\\nSpoilers for the first 30 minutes of the game that provide some additional context for my criticisms\\n[spoiler]\\nYour daughter dies at the beginning of the game, and the game goes edgelord immediately. Then 30 minutes in you'll meet another young girl who will accompany you and the game loses that tone immediately.\\n\\nThe story wants to drive a father + surrogate daughter narrative like the Last of Us Part 1, complete with the daughter figure being naive and cracking jokes. \\n\\nThe problem is, as you might expect, the quality of the writing and the characters is not good enough to make you care about the characters. Poor writing does impact the whole product negatively, but it would be a minor issue if the gameplay was the biggest priority. The problem is that the bad writing is given the same focus as the gameplay, and it got in the way of me having fun.\\n[/spoiler]\\n\\nEvery problem snowballs from here:\\n* The actual time it takes to scroll through text is WAY too long. The developers want to animate every line, but the cues are off and it takes 2-3 seconds to just get to the next line. This was a fatal flaw for me. The story constantly interrupted the gameplay, and I couldn't speed read past it,\\n* The quality of the writing is mixed, and pretty bad overall, at least it was in Japanese (I couldn't stand the English localization). It has its moments, but the sheer amount of time you spend in conversation gets in the way of the game's biggest strengths, its gameplay and music.\\n* The high quality pixel art in the first level shows what the game could have, but the second level is an industrial area made up of monotone browns that lack detail, and one boss is rendered as a 3D model whereas the other bosses are rendered with pixels. This shift in quality betrays the stellar visual presentation of the first section of the game, which is problematic because at this point I'm irritated with the dialogue. In the first section, having gorgeous visuals softened the blow.  The game makes up for this with strong art and presentation in the second half, however. \\n* Speaking of which, given the talent that the artists have, I don't understand why they decided to tell instead of show most of the story. The animations are fluid and gorgeous, but they play out mostly during dialogue, which is a waste.\\n* The final chapter of the game ties up the story and has really great gameplay, but it also has the most dialogue and some of it is unskippable. Also (minor spoiler) [spoiler]there's no final boss, the game instead closes on story beats. I don't know what could be a more fitting end to this review where my biggest complaint is that the story gets in the way of the gameplay[/spoiler] \\n* Last issue is minor. The game isn't hard and I wish the 1HKO difficulty was unlocked from the start.\\n\\n\\nI like this game, I recommend it, but I don't love it. There's a ton of talent and skill behind this game, which makes it all the more frustrating to see it get in its own way with poor presentation. Now I'm looking at Tevi as the next thing to calm me down for the long wait til Earthblade's release.\",\n",

Last I remember was Grapple Force Rena, but that was significantly slower. Otherwise, once you get used to it and start picking up speed it gets pretty fast in a hurry. Otherwise, the one ability that is a bit finicky to use is the charge dash, but it's not TOO bad\\n\\nMain issue that the game can have is the abundance of cut scenes and slow walking. Some cut scenes are unskippable, which can get annoying for folk doing multiple playthroughs, and during the slow walking segments it's hard to tell what's a cut scene and what isn't.\\n* Since Speedrun mode isn't out yet, we don't have that yet for proper practice or anything, but that should be resolved soon.\\n\\nMusic is great. Not much to really say there they all fit their situations. The Long Voyage was great.\\n\\nStory is pretty strong, even if the translation is not the greatest.

       " \"Honestly one of the best platformers I have ever played (definitely one of the best I have played in years) and was really excited when the full release came out after playing early access last year, the pacing of the gameplay including great implication of puzzles elevate this game to the same level as other greats like celeste. Honestly recommend it to all my friends that love platformers. The caste of characters are all bubbly and have great dialogue and the art is katana zero level of good. For me its definitely a 9/10 and as the developers work on improving the game it will definitely reach 10/10. It is already a staple for me in the genre and in indie games in general so I will always sings it praises. so if you continue to read my review know that my critique for the game is from a place of love and I really recommend this game.\\n\\nHowever there are two problems that I hope the developers due read in my review that I hope they will address, one minor and one I think is pretty major\\nThe Minor problem is the lack of a break in certain sections, for example without going into spoilers, there is was a part in the game where you encounter three set pieces (major action parts/boss fights) that happen one after another. The player is unable to find a suitable moment to exit the game without feeling that if he quits now he would it would ruin the experience in some sort of way. What do I mean by this? Well after the set piece ends the player immediately enters a cut scene that he is unable to pause and save than safely exit, he would only be able to pause the game after he skips the cutscene (which why would you? the cut scenes are great) or allow it to play out. Now for most this might not be such a bad thing, it just means there is just a lot of exciting and cool events in the game that can make a player play for hours. However not every player is like that and most times after a major set piece especially after a boss fight would normally save and exit the game. So it is not to start the next part of the game. Now you can save and exit after the cutscene but I feel like if a player came back the next week to play the game he or she would forget the context of the major set piece he or she was playing in therefore slightly hindering the experience. What I propose is before a cutscene starts (one that leads to the next boss fight or event) after a major set piece that the player must first interact with Marie than does the event trigger therefore not hindering pacing plus allowing players that opportunity that they now feel safe to save and exit the game because unironically the part of the game that I'm talking about the player's character is extremely exhausted which was how I felt after the three set pieces in the row.\\n\\nThe major one is using the controller. Since I have played the game mostly on the M&K I had no idea about how controller was like in the game until I had it plugged in the other night and decided to use it. There is a feature in the game the slows down time kinda like in katana zero (I had no idea this was even a feature) that allows the player to aim the grappling hook to where he wants to go. Now I didn't even once use it when I was M&K let alone I had even forgotten it was thing until I picked up the controller. Why is the ability triggered when ever you aim the grappling hook with the joystick? it should be a separate designated button, as it ruins all pacing in the game and makes it incredibly sluggish and frustrating as I was so use to just moving around super fast and making quick second decisions. I quickly unplugged my controller after that and continued to have fun on the M&K but please devs make it a separate button like in katana zero. allow controller users to decide if they are going to use the slow down ability or not than just forcing it on them.\",\n",
       " 'Played this game because I heard it was similar to Katana Zero, and was not disappointed. Really enjoyed the story and the mystery behind the plot, trying to figure everything out was both fun and rewarding. The aesthetic was also great. My only complaint was I felt like the gameplay at the end dragged on for a bit to long, as at that point I kind of wanted to wrap up the story. Still overall a enjoyable experience.',\n",

       " \"Came across this game, saw the art and saw the Steam reviews saying this was like Katana Zero (a personal favorite).\\n\\nI do see why people make the comparison to Katana Zero but I wouldn't make it personally. It has a a lot more platforming, and the grappling is quite different (and good fun). Even the combat is quite different, although again fun.\\n\\nWhile the platforming and combat is fun, it didn't blow me away on its own. What did blow me away was the total package for an indie studio (from what I can tell) making their first game. The length, pacing, music, and presentation are all superb, and more than worth the $12 I paid.\\n\\nThe pixel art is gorgeous, and the framing of so many scenes highlights the art even more. The music doesn't quite hit the heights of Katana Zero or Hotline Miami, but you get the pounding synth tracks for combat and then the slower and more quiet subtle tracks for the emotional moments. Really good stuff overall, and used in all the right places.\\n\\nThe game is also well paced, no single combat/platforming section or story section felt too long, keeping everything moving. Each area in the game introduces new mechanics specific to that area that also keeps you engaged and having to learn new things. No area feels too long or drawn out. By the end you are zipping along and it does feel good. Without spoiling anything, the last chapter in the game pays off the progression in game mechanics throughout the game beautifully.  The game is just the right length I felt too to let the story properly play out and unfold without dragging or any extra fat.\\n\\nGetting to the story- a lot of praise in the Steam reviews, and it is good. You get enough to put most of the puzzle together before the end, so you'll have some idea where it's going, but the way it unfolds is compelling, and you won't be able to figure eveything out before the end. The story really pays off emotionally with a touching ending too.\\n\\nWriting and text delivery deserves kudos too, a lá Katana Zero, so much tone, flow, and personality is exuded in the way text bubbles are presented, the way they overlap, sound, changes to the font, etc. The delivery really helps get you invested in the characters, specifically the main two, but also the side characters. Even characters who get little screen time I found myself caring about. The writing and characters really elevate an already solid plot.\\n\\nTo put a bow on it- all of these elements make for a game that's hard not to come away satisfied with. It just hits so many high notes on the presentation with the art, sound, story delivery, everything. The gameplay isn't super complex, but it is fast and fun, and it stays fresh, introducing new areas and mechanics at just the right pace.\\n\\nSpend $12, play this game. \\n\\nIf you have a Steam Deck, great way to play.\",\n",

OTOH, I [b]don\\'t[/b] want to recommend it because of the incomprehensible story (the spelling/grammar errors in the English translation certainly don\\'t do it any favors), the interminable cutscenes, and that the game seems determined to do everything in its power to get in the way of you enjoying it.\\n\\nHere\\'s the thing - the swinging is pretty fun! It feels good, the \"swing dash\" is honestly a really cool mechanic, and chaining together moves is really satisfying. But in the normal flow of gameplay, you get few opportunities to actually [b]DO[/b] any move chaining, thanks to all the barriers, walls you can\\'t latch on to, enemies shooting at you from a screen and a half away, etc. etc. ([i]Gravity Circuit[/i] this ain\\'t.) And I can not go any farther into this review without mentioning SANABI\\'s cardinal sin - the terrible, horrible, no good, very bad combination of overly bouncy knockback and a criminally short post-hit invincibility window.\\n\\nIf you ever hit the bottom edge of one of the red \"touch here and you get shot by an offscreen laser\" areas, you get bounced upward and thrown further into the red area, where you quickly get shot again, bounce up again, get shot again, rinse and repeat until you\\'re dead. And after you die, you\\'re treated to an instant halt of the music and a completely black screen for 5-10 seconds until it eventually gets around to restarting you at the last checkpoint. ([i]Celeste[/i] this ain\\'t). The same sort of pause happens every time you fall into one of the game\\'s numerous pits as well (including when you slide into one by accident, because there\\'s no real way to tell if the bottom of the screen is a pit or the way you have to go to the next section of the level).\\n\\nThankfully, there is a way to mitigate these issues somewhat - do yourself a favor and set the difficulty to Easy. When you don\\'t take any damage, there\\'s actually a chance for there to be some flow to the proceedings and it makes the game much more enjoyable as a result. I did that for Chapter 5 - after nearly rage-uninstalling due to the Chapter 4 boss, where falling in the pit at the bottom of the area resets [i]the entire fight[/i] - and the experience was much improved.\\n\\nI look forward to the next game from Wonder Potion - if they figure out how to make gameplay worthy of their art and music, it\\'ll truly be something special.',\n",

It\\'s what I wanted from a remake of Bionic Commando with a modern take, but it\\'s even dumb to say this as this is something special.\\nGame is great, highly recommend it if you like 2D platforming and speed. \\n\\nThat being said, take this as something I would prefer in the future and not really unremitting points of the game:\\n- Some levels / stage mechanics are underutilized or just redundant in the mechanics. Such as pushing stuff, it always goes back to place, but other things like cranes never do, it makes for weird design consistency and the pushing is highly underutilized\\n- Most of the mechanics are only used because of red walls blocking you, which makes for really stale mechanics\\n- Dialogue is HEAVILY repetitive, tons of information or plot structure happens too frequently, such as characters having conversations cut short by something or not answering questions, it could be cleaned up a bit more\\n- The \"limit removal\" could\\'ve been cooler, make the tackle not have a wait time and make the limiter feel even more powerful, because as is it feels just as a convenience\\n- Could\\'ve used more boss fights, the ones in here are ok but running away boss fights could\\'ve been really cool like in Ori\\n\\nThat\\'s just some points I think, but this game for sure it\\'s one of the shining star of this year. I\\'m dumbfounded not more people are talking about it.\\n\\nCongratulations, can\\'t wait the next project from this team.',\n",

      "[\"[h1] 8.5/10 [/h1]\\n\\nSANABI is definitely one of the most promising and best 2D Platformer indie action games I've played in recent years. With its innovative and creative gameplay, sophisticated pixel art style, easy-to-understand and immersive story, great music, and just the right amount of atmosphere, this game, still in its EA stage, is just too good for its same genre.\\n\\nThe gameplay is simple and easy to understand, but also requires skill to achieve precision. The plot is not obscure, with a simple and immersive story that makes it easy for any player to understand the game's going. The excellent level of design and distinctive boss fights add to the experience. I personally found the game to be relatively easy to play, and the adjustable difficulty makes it easy for all types of gamers to get the hang of it.\\n\\nThe game is not yet completed all the development, so players will inevitably be forced to stop playing when they are in the middle of the game. There are various shortcomings in the game, including but not limited to: the lack of recognizable scene design, the small font size of the character dialogs, the linear flow of the game, and the inability to go back through levels. Overall, the game still has a lot of room for improvement and I'm looking forward to it getting better and better.\\n\\nI don't need to tell you how good SANABI is again, but since the game is not yet complete, it's a good idea for those who want to experience the full game to either buy it first or wait and see. However, since the game is still in its early access stage, you may want to wait for the full game release or support the developers by buying it now. Judging from the roadmap released by the developer, we can expect great things from SANABI, and I, for one, am excited to see the game improve and evolve.\", \"If your a fan of Katana ZERO this will be another amazing game you must have.\\n\\nMelding amazing game play with a heartfelt story much deeper than it may first let on. \\n\\nGetting to the end isn't what's important, its the experiences along the way.\", 'TLDR; Pixel GOTY 2023. If you love Pixel games, Rich Plot & amazing music? This is the game for you, especially with that mix of the Cyberpunk aesthetic.\\nIF YOU LIKE THIS GAME, CHECK OUT EASTWARD. BEAUTIFUL PIXEL ART WITH EQUALLY AMAZING  STORY-LINE.\\n\\nI\\'m an incredibly avid pixel game fan, I\\'m not just speaking of classic Zelda, castlevania or Stardew. I\\'m a HUGE sucker for breathtaking pixel art visuals partnered with an amazing story.\\n\\nHonestly the only other game I can recommend that gives the same HUGE impact like this one has got to be Eastward.\\nEver since I played Eastward back in 2021, I was lost in the void constantly seeking and searching for a game that was honestly the exact same.\\n\\nBreathtaking visuals, banger music, fun mechanics, and very VERY rich storyline. But with the different amount of games (and trust me, I\\'ve searched EVERYWHERE), nothing came close to Eastward.\\n\\nUntil now.\\n\\nI, very rarely, actually sit down and bulldoze through a game, sometimes I get burnt out and \"take a break\" for a couple of days and if I end up not wanting to play as much as I first started then I have the tendency to just drop the game until further notice, sometimes never touching it ever again.\\nSo the fact this game broke through my standard protocol and I would rush home from work to immediately play and beat it in 3 days since I bought it? My goodness.\\n\\nTHAT\\'S how you KNOW it\\'s a great game.\\n\"Great\" doesn\\'t even COME CLOSE to how MAGNIFICENT this game is.\\n\\n2 years, I was searching for a game similar to one that had increases my standards in pixel gaming and was always disappointed or didn\\'t have my itch scratched, but this one will have to take the spot in my heart.\\n\\nNow I\\'ll be looking for a game that is similar to this one instead. The bar has increased and I\\'m so excited to see and play more games by Wonder Potion.\\n\\nThis game provided such an amazing adventure with so many new and amazing concepts, I can\\'t even begin to describe the PERFECT EXECUTION that this game provided. From the backstory, the hinting, to the plot twists and the end. It all pieced together so amazingly and ughhh I wish I could just forget the game and \"WIPE THE DATA\" from my memory so that I CAN EXPERIENCE IT AGAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME (sorry for my lame pun).\\n\\nAnyways, this game is  MUST PLAY, ABSOLUTELY. AND AGAIN, IF YOU LIKED THIS GAME, PLAY EASTWARD THANKS BYE.', \"Its hard for me to really describe how much fun I'm having with this game. This is definitely an action game but unlike any I have really played before. They make a Grappling Hook not only one of the most fun ways to traverse any environment but also a deadly weapon that stops enemies in their tracks as long as you are accurate enough to hit your target. This game is really ENTIRELY skill based because of its elegantly simple combat mechanic. Simple to understand but difficult and satisfying to master (at least for me on my XBox controller) \\n\\nIt has a familiar cyberpunk aesthetic but comes at the cyberpunk genre from a different perspective. You can see the normal Cyber Punk Archetypes but because the story and the world have so much character they feel fresh along with the world.\\n\\nThe music is intense and makes you feel like everything you are doing is the most important thing in the world. It compliments the moment to moment game play in a way that half the time you feel like you are a Master  one moment and the next moment scrambling to keep up with the pace. \\n\\nThis game isn't open world but every minute you are playing the game the world still feels deeper, and even though the point of the game is to explore an abandoned city the city still feels more alive then most open world games. \\n\\nAnd then there'ss the STORY, I didn't think I was going to get this into the narrative. Your main character has depth in a 2D Game just based on their actions, how they handle loss, their motives and what scares them. All while giving off this Batman Vibe. The story is a mystery that you unravel with each passing minute and there are actual moments in this where I was literally gasping with shock. The pacing of the game just keeps making you want to learn more and get better at the mechanics so you can explore more\\n\\nIn this game the story and the world are directly tied so by discovering more about the story you are effectively exploring this world. The Screenplay is top notch and understands that every character to stand out CANNOT sound/feel the same and when our characters meet others that have personalities that clash it actually pushes the story forward instead of just being a cute moment. \\n\\nThis game takes the 2D Platformer Genre and kicked down all the barriers that would make it feel flat or without depth. Cyberpunk 2077 could only hope to have the kind of seemingly effortless story telling chops this game has.\\n\\nAnd then you have the PIXEL ART. Just on another level. when I was a kid playing SNES I don't think I could have dreamed of a better Pixel Art game.\\n\\nThis game gets me excited for my steam deck\", '[b]what i liked:[/b]\\n\\n+ interesting and well thought out cyberpunk narrative with it\\'s own unique charm and an intriguing lore.\\n\\n+ compelling and emotional story. the opening really caught me off guard, be prepared! loved the overall writing so far.\\n\\n+ gorgeous pixel artstyle and a stunning art direction. definitely one of the best looking pixel games out there. the backdrops are crafted with care and an eye for details.\\n\\n+ the animations are quite well done. excellent work which makes the scenes feel more a live.\\n\\n+ fast and responsive controls which makes platforming and combat a pleasure.\\n\\n+ the grapling arm is such a fun tool for toying around and you\\'ll get more and more possibilities in use the further you get.\\n\\n+ difficulty seems pretty easy at first, even on higher difficulties, but will get much tougher once you progress further into the game.\\n\\n+ a fair amount of checkpoints and repair stations (healing) to prevent frustration.\\n\\n+ diverse and enjoyable boss fights with different themes and unique mechanics. the overall difficulty is pretty high and i loved every second of it.\\n\\n+ many memorable characters throughout the game.\\n\\n+ insane soundtrack, so many bangers - it\\'s a delight.\\n\\n\\n[b]what felt debatable to me:[/b]\\n\\n~ keep in mind sanabi is a plot heavy game with many \"cutscenes\" and dialogues, so if you\\'re coming only for the gameplay, you may get somewhat disappointed despite having some excellent gameplay to offer, since there are a lot of slow paced narrative parts without any  gameplay at all. personally i do love the game how it is, so more of a pro for me, but i had to point this fact out for other players.\\n\\n~ no achievements in this early access at the moment.\\n\\n~ the length of the early access is on the shorter side.\\n\\n\\n[b]what i disliked:[/b]\\n\\n- didn\\'t like the dialogue font in general and there are some even more disturbing aspects to it. it\\'s partly different sized to highlight people shouting or so and the letters are shaking at times - pretty unpleasant to read, i have to admit.\\n\\n- sometimes the dialogue boxes are almost completely overlapping each other which makes the back one kinda impossible to read.\\n\\n- yet again another dialogue issue. sometimes characters are auto continuing their dialogues quite quickly and i was barely (or unable) to read everything.\\n\\n- cut these modern meme words (boomer, jk, sheesh, yada yada, sus, and so on - you get the point) from your dialogues. it simply feels lazy written and is killing the immersion to a problematic degree. i really don\\'t need some internet douches talking meme language in my videogames, at least not in this kind of game.\\n\\n\\n8.5/10 due to some excellent design choices, but they definitely have to step up their dialogue presentation. sanabi is narrative heavy and story driven with much text, so you have to make this aspect of the game as pleasant as possible. the potential for a 10/10 is definitely there!', \"I didn't expect that I would be so invested in the story of the game when I read the description 'Katana-Zero meets Spider-Man', let alone have the game make me laugh and cry, but here we are.\\n\\nAbsolutely brilliant focused experience, so much fun. Gameplay is fantastic, music is banging, story is wonderful, the art is gorgeous. Truly one of the greats and I hope to see more from the creators.\\n\\nCannot recommend this game enough.\", \"TLDR: \\n- after completing all the content currently in the game on normal difficulty, I can *heartily* recommend SANABI - even at full price! Solid action platformer with fluid movement, surprisingly engaging story (very much looking forward to future chapters), and some amazing art/music direction. Minimal cons, really just nitpicks. Buy this game! \\n\\nPros:\\n- Good Music \\n- Great Art \\n- Fluid Movement - some of the best of any platformer i've played \\n- Interesting (enough) Combat \\n- A story which was fine in the beginning, but really hooked me into the building story-arc by the time i reached the end - it left me wanting more in a good way. Lots to look forward to as more content is added to the game!!!\\n- 2 good bossfights \\n- inclusion of a speedrun mode is really nice, for those who want *everything* timed. and getting rid of cutscenes for future playthroughs\\n- the protagonist has real motives and, despite his somewhat limited dialogue, acts like a fairly real person. written concisely i think would be a good term \\n- the deuteragonist was a little annoying at first, but definitely grew on me\\n- there was a really really cool moment towards the end of the currently playable content, i won't spoil it but i made me jump a little lol \\n\\nCons: \\n- 1 bad bossfight. middle child is always neglected, i guess? it's not really *offensively* bad, just not nearly as good as the other two. \\n- Some of the stage gimmicks are too easy \\n- the higher difficulties don't change the game enough, they just make you health progressively lower. in retrospect i could've even put the game on the highest difficulty (where you have 1 hp) and only really struggled with a handful of platforming sections, and one of the bosses in particular\\n- there's only one save slot atm\\n- this means in order to play the timed portions of the tutorial you need to erase current progress ( a way to access these in the main menu maybe?)\\n- some of the signs and notes in cutscenes are untranslated from korean (as this is a brand new korean indie studio, i give them a lot of slack in this department, the english TL of the story is better than a lot of native-english game writing these days)\\n- some of the audio settings are too loud by default, even with my system audio being pretty quiet, and some of the audio effects are disproportionately tuned (footsteps on a steel floor in a cutscene being louder than some of the gunshots right after). not a massive deal though, only broke my immersion once at the very beginning, and after i tuned audio sliders all was well.\\n\\nOverall i'd say the majority of my Cons are nitpicks, and i purposefully kept a lot of what i *couldve* praised in the Pros concise or absent so as to not spoil some of the great fun in this game. \\n\\nVery very much looking forward to what the team at WONDER POTION do with this project next!\", '[h3]~ ~ ~T E C H N O S T A L G I C ~ ~ ~ [/h3]\\n[h3]~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ R E V I E W ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~[/h3]\\n[quote=Macho Man Randy Savage] \"I\\'ve cried a thousand times and I\\'m gonna cry some more.\" [/quote] ⠀\\nGameplay: 10 (Amazing Grappling mechanics and good physics.)\\nStory: 9⠀(You might cry.

If you have ever mastered games in the past like Sonic The Hedgehog for the Genesis, you will feel a lot of satisfaction as you quickly progress through each stage section and master the simple to learn, but hard to master grappling hook mechanic. The grappling hook is the main mechanic and focus in Sanabi. As you get better at the controls the more freedom you will have while traversing the stages which is extremely satisfying.\\n\\nIf you love older platformers like Sonic and Mario this is a must play for you. I can\\'t stress how good the grappling mechanic is. Only time will tell but this will potentially be a classic in the years to come.\\n\\n\\n⠀', 'Great game with a similar artstyle to Katana Zero, but the gameplay is vastly different. Highly recommend.', 'Sanabi is an awesome platformer. The moves are quick and snappy and feel good to chain together. The art is goregous and the level design is awesome! For $15 it is 100% worth it.\\n\\nbut why does the Overseer bit exist I hate it', \"An outstanding experience. Rarely do I go on about a game without talking a bit of smack for fun beforehand, but I cannot with SANABI. I just completed the EARLY ACCESS on it's hardest difficulty (Die from one hit) thinking I could handle it. And while I did make it through, it was harder than even Katana Zero.\\n\\nGameplay - 10/10. This game not only plays smoothly, especially when you get a hang of it, but it makes you look cool while doing so. Maybe it's my appeal towards hookshots but man oh man, was it fun. Platformers are generally not my thing, but SANABI is a whole new level that allows you to move in ways most platformers wouldn't and in an intuitive manner. Though some of the bosses (JUSTICE) were extremely difficult, the frustration never fully seeped in cause of the learning experience behind it.\\n\\nStory - 8/10 - I cannot fully evaluate the story to be fair, cause the reality is, it's not finished quite yet. But the story is entertaining. Maybe it's cause I voice acted over the characters speaking, but it brought in intensity. The characters were likable to say the least. Honestly, if they need a voice actor, I hope I can be the one who does it for the main (Unnamed?) character. (I legitimately voice acted the whole game for each character too) The game provides charm and a bit of something else to it that really brings out the environment. One thing I will state for the benefit of the developer though.\\n(THERE ARE SOME GRAMMATICAL ERRORS! I WISH I SAVED A SCREEN SHOT OF EACH ONE! I APOLOGIZE! THERE WERE ABOUT 3!)\\n\\nGraphics/Art Style - 10/10 - This one's a bit of a tricky situation. Maybe it's my appeal to pixel art, but the animations really emphasize on making the game feel what it is. As mentioned before, the game play makes you look cool, but the animations themselves are part of the reason why. From flipping into the air, to landing on a wall in specific ways. This game provides a lot and puts heart into it that I cannot deny.\\n\\nMusic - 6/10 - Maybe it's because I'm picky as a musician, but the music didn't exactly WOW me compared to everything else in the game. It wasn't bad, just not mind blowing. Though I will say this much, it did it's job well. It provided to each environment in the correct tone. Though, there was a bit to be desired from it.\\n\\nOverall - 10/10 - While I may dismiss some aspects of the game, I'm not going to just deteriorate my overall score. The game play more than satisfied what I've wanted out of a game in a long time. It provided a challenge that was fabulous and an intensity that most games don't in this day and age. A fantastic game that I cannot wait to finish in the future.\", \"I found Sanabi being recommended in Katana 0's Reddit. I started playing it with low expectations, just thinking about it as a korean katana 0 clone.\\n\\nThe first couple hours my opinion didnt really change, but the gameplay kept getting harder and I decided to give it a fair shot.\\n\\nSoon after that, I started loving Mari. Next thing I know, i am swinging around like a madman while solving a huge conspiracy involving a whole city. Also, the ending made me emotional lol.\\n\\n\\nSuper good game with a unexpectedly good story, definitely a hidden gem. Pick it up if you like platformers or the vibes.\", '(I played the full game now; I\\'m changing this review to positive and will write more details later. The rest of the message is the old review)\\n\\n-----\\n\\n(Keep in mind this review was written back in Early Access; I still need to revisit the game to give it a more fair rating and review)\\n\\nI can\\'t, with a light conscience, recommend this game as it is right now, as much as I want to.\\nKeep in mind that the game is in early access, and a lot of what I\\'ll be saying might change for the better; this is exactly why I\\'m writing this review.\\n\\nFirst, let\\'s start with the negatives:\\n(-) The cutscenes and dialogues are too frequent, and break the pacing of the game quite a lot. There are dozens of very long cutscenes, many of which don\\'t seem to be necessary.\\n(-) The dialogues have several problems; even in the intro sequence, it\\'s possible to spot moments where text boxes don\\'t seem to match the context, or dialogues don\\'t make sense, at least in English.\\n(-) The translation is incorrect or inaccurate, which adds to the dialogue being bad.\\n(-) The dialogue goes TOO FAST during action sequences. I think dialogue during action sequences is great, but having it be unreadable is just frustrating and not fun; I had to pause during my playthrough during these dialogues, when I cared about it.\\n(-) The story is intriguing, which makes this all the more frustrating; you really want to take the game seriously, but these problems make it so that it\\'s hard to.\\n(-) The game doesn\\'t really explain to you about clockwise and counter-clockwise movement with the dash. Although players will eventually figure it out, I think with the amount of tutorials, the game could have told me that as well.\\n(-) There was some untranslated Korean text in a few cutscenes. It\\'s understandable with the scenery, but I think it would do good just to have some subtitles, you know?\\n(-) Some areas seem very empty or incomplete, bland, with nothing new. I think these would be a good opportunity for the game to put some of the exceeding dialogue, instead of cramming all of it into a million cutscenes. Namely, I can see the \"plan\" sequences working out during these more empty parts.\\n(-) There were some opportunities lost with gameplay. I think this would be a perfect game to play with more momentum mechanics and bunny hopping. Making that easier and accessible for the player would be a good idea. Instead, touching the ground while attached to a hook just makes you lose all momentum. Also, retracting to your hook does not make you keep your speed when you cancel the retraction, and I think that\\'s a big lost opportunity.\\n(-) The parts with throwing the enemies into the laser just felt a lot more boring than the idea sounded like.\\n(-) There are no secrets and no real hidden easter eggs or anything like that. At least none that I could find. I feel like this game would greatly benefit from having several collectibles and hidden areas, to explore everything you can do with the tech of the hook.\\n( ? ) This might be just me, but I didn\\'t understand health and checkpoints very well. I\\'ve finished the game in about 3 hours or so, on hard mode, and had about 2 or 3 deaths; but I thought I was supposed to die after 2 hits? It semeed like I had 4 health instead, despite playing on \"hard\", where I was supposed to die in 2 hits.\\n\\nNow let\\'s talk about the good points:\\n(+) The gameplay is fluid and satisfying; it\\'s a character that is \"fun to play as\". The hook movement just works, and having a game based solely on that is a good plus.\\n(+) The artstyle is beautiful; it reminds me of Katana Zero a lot. There is even a Katana Zero reference inside the game (time samurai, lmao)\\n(+) Add this to having several animations for the characters. Characters have many different poses and expressions, and it seems like it never ends. Specially, Mari and the Daughter were really adorable during the cutscenes.\\n(+) The screen transitions feel smooth! I like that a lot in the game.\\n(+) It has a good sense of humor in the dialogue. I feel like some jokes drag on for too long, but in general, it\\'s likeable and I did laugh a few times.\\n(+) The music is good! Not phenomenal, but it was nice to listen to.\\n(+) The story is intriguing, and it did make me a bit emotional. Although the beginning is so positive and wholesome, that you know exactly what\\'s going to happen after.\\n\\n\\nOverall, this game needs little to be an amazing game, but it\\'s important to let devs know about the problems with it.\\nAs the game keeps getting updated, I\\'ll keep playing it, and I\\'ll update my review when I can and when I think the game is in a better state.\\n\\nIf you want to try it out yourself to see what I\\'m talking about, and perhaps just feel that sick gameplay, I do recommend the game; I just can\\'t tell anyone to try playing this game for a fun and enjoyable experience.', '[b]Katana ZERO + Spider-Man = Sanabi[/b]\\n\\nPlays [i]GREAT[/i] on Steam Deck, after 2 hours at time of review I had zero issues with the game; despite the warning that it sometimes shows MKB controls I had no such problems. The story is good, the setting looks amazing, it runs smoothly, plays smoothly, has fast fun action in a cyberpunk setting, and the only complaint is [i]how dare you make me feel things![/i] \\n\\nI could tell you more about the story or the gameplay, but that\\'s what the Steam Page is for, I love the grappling hook mechanic; it\\'s smooth, and when you hit it just right you feel [i]awesome[/i]. \\n\\nThere is a slight resolution issue where the top part of the screen is black, as though it\\'s on widescreen mode, but the bottom of the screen is just fine. It\\'s weird, it doesn\\'t fix regardless of resolution setting, but it doesn\\'t bug me as much as it might bug other people. The fact I can\\'t remove the version number from the top left of the screen bugs me more than the letterbox resolution issue. \\n\\nOverall, it\\'s a great time and I\\'m having a lot of fun with it, it\\'s honestly the sole reason I dislike Early Access games: I know I\\'m going to reach the end of the content and have to wait for more without getting the whole game and the story I\\'m so far very invested in.\\n\\n** Edited Review Below **\\n\\nAs of 10/08/23 I\\'ve now played a near total 6 hours of the game and completed all the EA content. I need more, I want more. Hopefully I don\\'t have to wait too long for the finished product but as of right now it\\'s a fun game with minimal combat, decent story, fun characters. You could probably speedrun the content in an hour, the story itself is probably 4-5 hours itself as long as you don\\'t die often, which admittedly I did.\\n\\nNo glitches, no bugs, the game says use MKB but again, zero issues on Steam Deck. The control map in the settings does show MKB controls which is probably where the Steam Deck verification \"Playable\" label comes from, but I made no adjustments to the settings.\\n\\nFull recommendation, if you liked Katana Zero and/or grappling hook/swinigng mechanics this is the easiest recommendation of my life.', '[h1]Check out my 60 sec review:[/h1]\\nhttps://youtu.be/fJpT3eE8mnY\\n\\nI will make a full gameplay also!\\n\\n[h1]Short Version Review:[/h1]:\\nSanabi is a dystopian action-plataformer.\\nNote: I’m reviewing the early access version.\\n\\nFreaturing a legendary retired veteran that is seeking revenge against SANABI for what it has done to him!\\nYou will be dodging bullets, creating havoc and bringing destruction to your enemies!\\n\\nYou will also meet a very cute hacker, ops, expert intelligence acquisitionist, named Mari.\\nShe will help you out in this chaotic and corrupted world\\n\\nThe [b]sound design[/b] is superb\\n\\nThe [b]gameplay and controls[/b] are fluid and responsive\\n\\nThe [b]art design[/b] is gorgeous\\n\\nThe [b]characters[/b] are memorable and very charismatic\\n\\nThe story is very interesting, after all, it is a dystopian universe\\nYou will try to figure out what the heck is happening around you in this very aggressive universe, where everything is trying to kill you\\n\\nThe English translations is good enough, but some scenery background and drawings are not fully translated yet\\nI could use some more portraits when the characters where talking, but, unfortunately, the portrait section is limited to some sparse moments\\n\\n[b]Game length[/b]:\\nIn its actual early access patch (06.22.2022 - mm.dd.yyyy), I took [b]3h50min[/b] from the beginning until the LAST released chapter ([b]**IT IS NOT the full game**[/b]).\\n[b]It may vary[/b] depending on how good you are in plataforming and with the mechanics of the game, and, of course, if you skip or not the dialogues.\\n\\nThe Game Final Score is Nine out of ten', \"Though I've only played for around 2 hours, I've gone through the entire game. There is a good amount of content here for what it is and more to come. Clearly inspired by Katana Zero, this game focuses much harder on the movement aspect of these games to great effect. Highly recommend the pick up if you are looking for something similar. \\n\\nThere are some complaints I have though, the main one being polish. While this game looks and plays great, there are some things that become apparent when you start playing. The settings don't reset when reloading the game. Some of the grammar in the dialog is messed up, probably an easy fix. Your grappling hook reel-in is tied to the up arrow, however if you put jump on the up arrow as I do in my platformers, it can cause some annoying movement, reeling in when you meant to jump and continue your momentum. Also speed-run mode, probably what will be the main draw for games like this, still displays cutscenes and dialog and can even bug out to the point of turning the screen completely black. This is early access though and I expect that these bugs and features will be ironed out for the final release.\\n\\nAs for the rest of it? Movement is smooth and flowing when the level allows for it, you can get REALLY fast here. Some of the levels are worse than others, requiring you to stop and wait for something before continuing on. Mostly a personal gripe, I like flowing and continuous movement in my games. And the OST, it slaps. Where can I find this music, I need it.\\n\\nOverall: 7/10 Very solid platformer with a good story and crisp movement. Some things need tuning but when the game is released, I suspect this will be an 8-9/10. Easily worth the money.\", \"First and foremost, I need to say if you are somebody who has played purely from the demo and just picked up wherever your save file left off at, I strongly encourage you to scrap it and restart. There were a variety of wonderful touch ups and additions added to the beginning which, while not essential to view, are fun and can add nicely to some subtle moments. And who are we kidding this game is succinct and lovely to play through any number of times for the movement alone. Now to the actual review:\\n\\n\\nI have been invested in this game prior to its release, having played on the original demo available and the betas available at the given time, the game even then was passionate and filled with heart that greatly excited me for its final release. To my surprise, when it did actually release I already had access to the game, presuming it was an error or a final demo update I played through immediately.\\n\\nMuch to my surprise I had received the full game for free, at this point I'm still not sure if this was an error due to me having the demo and beta in my library or intentional on the developers part for the final release. This aside, I seldom feel obligated to comment on anything, but I was genuinely taken aback by this game having been granted the chance to play through it fully completed now. \\n\\nThe art and style was phenomenal and only grew stronger beyond the already released demo section. The integration of mechanics was tied nicely often with story beats and transitioned seamlessly into teaching applications of the mechanics directly in the platforming promoting alternate methods of using some of them. The platforming also encouraged creative problem solving for those looking for more unconventional solutions or speed running advantages. I'm avoiding talking on the story as it is incredibly well done for the tale it wishes to tell, and I am no one to spoil that. What I will say on it is that it is well structured in the sense the player is only as aware as they choose to be; which I think perfectly builds into the aesthetic and narrative itself. The games story delivers where it matters most, being heartfelt, meaningful, and while not getting so broad as to water down its core story. All in all, I loved this game, it vindicates the player and makes actions feel worth it even more so by that ending.\\n\\nFor nitpicks, most of my issues are realistically non-issues, and more so quality of life gripes(3).\\n-In the English translation specifically there are a variety of grammatical errors, however none are overly detrimental to the moment or the overall understanding of what's going on. \\n-There are a few issues in terms of optimization at this current point, the amount of assets present seems to be delaying the rate of level loading times which can lead to longer black screen load times. While load screens aren't entirely a bad thing, these also apply to falling off the map in which your speed run timer will keep running, which presents some issues.. \\n-The last is a more specific issue for those who played the demo. If you had a save file that had unlocked Legendary at that time period and was using it, upon beginning the full game from where you left off you were locked to that state and unable to change due to Legendary being an unlock feature, which required a full game restart to be able to change it. Given how this would be difficult to adjust I understand how this came to be a bug and may be helpful to simply make a toggle if the game reads the save as having that setting enabled prior to the unlock to allow for the player to adjust down to an appropriate play level to still earn the Legendary mode.\\n\\nTLDR; Game good, very pretty, heartfelt story, chain arm go zoom, and actually play from beginning. I wish the team the best, thank you for your wonderful game.\", '10/10!!!!\\nI think this game is awesome!\\n\\nThe Pixel Art is absolutely STUNNING \\n(reminding me of the pixel art in \"Katana Zero\" BUT BETTER) \\nand it is the BEST I HAVE EVER SEEN a game utilise the art style!\\n\\nThe Grapple-Hook Movement based gameplay is also extremely fun and different, with unique layouts in each area making each new level always feel fresh.\\n\\nI love the charm and writing of the characters and story!!! \\nThe devs show true passion in this product, \\nalso they put in so many extra unnecessary details such as references to countless other games hiding away in the background.\\n\\nalso there were a few really cool badass moments \\nand there were also some parts which legitimately terrified me lol XD\\n\\nanyway I would highly recommend to people who...\\nhell I\\'d highly recommend this to anyone!\\n\\nAs of writing this the game is still in early access and I can\\'t wait for the rest to come out!', 'Truly an incredible game.\\n\\nGameplay was a blast, music was good, art style was incredible and the animations of the characters surprised me with how good it was and the story is just so good..', '[h1]SANNABI The Revenant[/h1]\\n\\nLet the anguish take control and swing for the fences. SANNABI The Revenant launches you over, under, and across the dystopian future with an agonizing vengeance. I’ve really fallen in love with the platformers recently published by Neowiz, such as Metal Unit and Skul: The Hero Slayer, which I had the pleasure to review. So when I caught wind of this project, developed by Wonder Potion, my heart leapt with anticipation. I had no idea what I was getting myself into.\\n\\nYou are a retired veteran soldier, who has gone away from the violence to a quiet life with your young daughter. Being a father is amazing, and the memories you create with your daughter are priceless. Life is bliss. Until you get a visit out of nowhere from someone in your past… who brings a pain that will soon become your driving force.\\n\\nSANNABI is a 2D action-platformer, but not like any other I remember playing. So far, in this demo version of the game, the enemies aren’t actually your main concern, the environment is. Not with spewing balls of lava or with bodies of water to drown in, but just by being itself. Sure, there are a few enemies here and there that you need to take care of, but I found myself being killed by the landscape I was trying to latch onto (or land on) more often than not.\\n\\nThis introduces the most difficult aspect of the game for me: the platforming is done mostly by swinging. Your chain-hook prosthetic arm gives you the ability to latch on to most of the surfaces from a distance, so you’ll use it to literally fly across the screen. Some of the objects you latch onto will let you redirect yourself off of them, giving it a controllable pinball feel.\\n\\nSwinging from one platform to the next sounds serene and calming, right? Not in SANNABI. This game takes the concept, represented in my mind most by a friendly neighborhood kid in a red and blue jumpsuit, and smashes it into a mixer with bolts of body-jolting electricity and break-neck speed. Which is where the difficulty comes in. Most times I was swinging so fast I had hardly enough (if any at all) time to react and shoot my chain-hook at the next ledge. And if that wasn’t difficult enough, some of the surfaces are too sheer to grab onto, or even electrocuted. Partner this with insta-deaths when touching electricity, and a very low threshold to take damage from enemies, and this is one of the more difficult games to get the hang of in recent memory.\\n\\nSANNABI takes place in MAGO. The city of MAGO is a dark, neon-lit technological metropolis set in a retro graphics aesthetic. From what you recall, the city was run by a criminal faction when you were an active soldier. in the time I spent on this game, I felt enveloped by the dark atmosphere, like a vigilante launching myself over buildings in a permanent nightfall. The music was very “cyber-esque” and set the perfect backdrop to the stage.\\n\\nSANNABI was a really fun experience. This small taste of the story has me excitedly anticipating the full release of the game. However, the action and mechanics applied were extremely difficult to wrap my fingers around. I’ve never been good with fast paced games on the keyboard, because my fingers usually move off of the keys due to excitement. This problem came out in full force as I played through this demo. The ability to play with a controller is there, but it only made things even more difficult. It uses the same controls to move your character as it does to aim your chain-arm. The option to customize the configuration would make the experience a million times better. This being considered, though, I still really enjoyed this experience, and look forward to more. I’m hyped to swing for the fences in the full game.', 'SANABI has fantastic physics, great graphics and art style, fun story, and it runs amazingly well on my 2016 potato PC.', '[h1]Sanabi[/h1]\\nCool dramatic game with elements of humor, gameplay is easy [i](but not on bosses)[/i]. Art style is incredible and detailed! Soundtrack is just okay but some extremely clingy ones!', 'The game\\'s story goes from 0 to 100, really fucking fast, and and it\\'s the highlight of the game, by far. Characters are interesting, and it does have some funny moments here and there for what I would describe overall as a pretty dark and dystopian atmosphere. The mystery that\\'s going on isn\\'t cut and dry, so you\\'re kept guessing what\\'s going on. The only \"twist\" that you could see coming from a mile away is essentially having to go through this game\\'s version of the Mines of Moria. Only small nitpicks are that the game does have a few small typos here and there, and some world building gets left out. One example being when the main characters mention that the government says some research is banned and illegal, and I\\'m sitting here wondering, \"Why is it illegal? Was there some event that led to it being made illegal?\" But again, nitpicks.\\n\\nMy only gripes are that the main mechanic of the grappling arm doesn\\'t control very well in some places, the platforming can be really tight in some areas, and it makes it difficult to tell how you\\'re supposed to progress through some areas, as in, \"where am I supposed to go? I can\\'t see anything on the screen to latch onto\". For context, I\\'m playing with a controller here, so maybe it\\'s less finicky with a keyboard and mouse? Additionally, there are times that it feels like the invincibility frames after getting hit are way too short, and I get that it\\'s meant as a recovery mechanic, but when some random platform goes into a danger zone, you\\'re knocked off, and some bullet randomly hits you and you get hit again by the danger zone...it gets kind of tiresome. I will say, I wish there was a type of general purpose dodge sometimes, that doesn\\'t involve getting hit.\\n\\nCombat\\'s pretty decent, the normal mooks aren\\'t too much trouble and it\\'s insanely fun to zip around the map killing enemies. That is, until this one enemy starts showing up partway through chapter 2, and turns some fights into less of a combat encounter, and more of a puzzle fight, and not in a good way. Having to maneuver enemies into certain positions gets really annoying, but outside of that section, that particular enemy did not reappear in chapter 3, which is the furthest you can go at the time of review.\\n\\nBoss fights on the other hand are much more entertaining, with a few small hiccups here and there for some fights. The only downside I can say is that there\\'s no checkpoint system for any of them, so if you die at any point, you\\'re starting at the beginning of the fight once again. It\\'s a pro for some people, a con for others. It\\'s not that bad for the first boss since it\\'s not the longest boss fight in the world, but it becomes a pain for the second, especially considering how many times you need to knock them down, and the \"process\" to knock them down...\\n\\nOverall, the game\\'s pretty entertaining for what\\'s there, and I\\'m pretty invested into the story at this point, so I\\'m really interested to see where it goes.', \"Very good game, suffers from pacing issues throughout and a weird difficulty spike but the narrative payoff in the last third is worth every bit of it. Maybe one of my favourite last thirds in any indie game I've played so far. Great pixel art, a kick-ass synth soundtrack and fun gameplay, basically Katana ZERO with a grappling hook.\\nI recommend\\n\\n[h1] 8.5/10 [/h1]\", \"I cried. I've never done that for a game before but, God damn it, [u]SANABI[/u] perfectly punched me in the God damn heart and wrung me dry of tears. \\n\\nBasically, think if a fan of [u]Katana Zero[/u] wanted to make their own [u]Bionic Commando[/u] game; you have a hookshot arm that's extremely fun to use and that's all compounded by a story of incredible twists and turns.\\n\\nThe localisation kind of sucks, which undermines some of the more emotional moments and makes certain logistics throughout the story threatening to the immersion, but the story beats are all solid.\\n\\nI just think the game lacks something at the end: [spoiler]a proper final boss fight. After the final cutscene before the credits, I thought it would've been nice to put everything we've learned into one final adventure and put a stop to the nuclear reactor THROUGH GAMEPLAY. It would've capped off the emotional climax of that cutscene and provided us with a great final challenge. As is, the game just kind of sort of ends after we've run through every level again and it's a bit anticlimactic.[/spoiler]\\n\\nAll in all, absolutely sublime. Thrilling and exciting to play, story strikes you where it hurts. Play it.\", \"PLAY IF:\\n   - You enjoy 2D platformers similar to Katana Zero or (somewhat) the gameplay loop of Hotline Miami.\\n   - You are willing to withstand occasional nonsense level design/bugs.\\n    ---------------    \\nThis is quite possibly the most conflicted I have ever felt completing a video game. This game's highs are jubilant, featuring some of the most freeing movement in a 2D platformer and a story that subverts one's expectations in a way that feels earned and powerful rather than a cheap plot point like many lesser stories.\\nInversely, however, this game inspired such frustration within me that I had not previously thought possible, with the game's targeting system with the hook and the late-game charging move. (I am aware that there is a setting for aim-assist for the hook, but I had problems both with it on and off.) I also encountered several bugs during the final boss fight in which the boss would freeze in an idle pose with full invincibility. (In hindsight, I believe this was caused by resetting to last checkpoint on the frame she was transitioning from or to a move) This game was also originally written in Korean, as while it is very well localized, the translation itself features some minor errors and, more importantly, many vague sentences that make it unclear what exactly is happening.\\nThis game has undeniable faults, but I still recommend it to anyone who enjoys intense 2D platformers or, thanks to the game's many difficulty options, anyone who would be interested by a heartstrings-pulling story. I would also highly recommend playing on keyboard and mouse, as despite the unwieldy keybindings, you may edit them as you choose and aiming the hook is significantly more satisfying. \\n...Yeah, I think that about covers it.\", 'This is a fast paced action platformer. People who love games with a good story will love this one.\\n\\nIt speaks for itself that speedrunners will be satisfied also. The movement and controls work very fluent.

The artstyle is great. And the soundtrack is amazing.\", 'Overall, the game is fun but it has a lot of very un-fun things about it. \\n\\nPros: Swinging around feels great most of the time and you feel very in-control of your movement. Nice, fun platforming in general, I just wish it was a little more difficult.\\n\\nCons: I don\\'t really care about the story, so for me it had WAAAAY too many cutscenes, unskippable dialog, and slow pointless RP walking when I just wanted to get back to swinging around. My other big issue is that some of the \"puzzles\" have a very tight window to complete (which isn\\'t a big deal once you know what to do) but it can be frustrating when you have to replay them multiple times because there\\'s no way for you to know what\\'s coming next and if you fail, you have to start over. Just zooming out a bit would honestly help this so you have at least some amount of time to react and don\\'t automatically fail a section multiple times because you didn\\'t predict what the next hurdle was going to be.', \"Very promising grappling hook platformer with roughly 2-3 hours worth of story mode gameplay right now.\\nThe grapple mechanics are fun and well built upon.\\n\\nStory is intriguing enough but it's quite wordy and cutscenes happen a bit too frequently. Unlike Katana Zero, there is no player input or dialogue options during cinematics. The cutscenes themselves are a lot of fun however, with lots of small animations for both the characters and the environments.\\n\\nPixel art is obviously fantastic, particularly the background art and aforementioned character animations. Music is fitting but not very memorable.\", \"I think its an amazing game with a great story. Not much to say regarding the mechanics since its pretty simple, but its fun to swing around and try to go as fast as I can. The story was interesting, but some parts were pretty predictable after a while.

There was much more story than I was expecting, with probably 1/4 of the time playing being plot-driven/narrative-based. While I wish there was less story than this, that's mainly because of how the main gameplay works - as I said, it's fast-paced and the movement feels super smooth, so it can be a bit jarring to go from that to a discussion between characters. Ultimately, I think the devs delivered this juxtaposition as well as they could with an engaging storyline to boot. Aside from that, the only other thing I wish was different is that in some areas, hitting terrain that hurts you (primarily areas with red lasers), you can easily get stun-locked into dying. It's not a big deal given save points are frequent, but there were several times I hit a laser and knew I would have to wait for it to hit me three more times so I could die and start over instead of having the chance to reposition myself (which would be more skill-expressive, IMO) and carry on.\\n\\nSANABI has a little bit of everything going for it - action, adventure, platforming, combat, a relevant storyline, and a fantastic soundtrack to accompany it all. If you dig the look of the game and want something that simply feels great to play, I recommend this title.\", \"My personal GOTY of 2024, and the year only started, i haven't been this emotional since watching the ending of Stein's;Gate.\\n\\nMust Play.\", 'Brilliant graphics, expressive characters, and a heartwarming plot about father and daughter, packed with a slick grappling hook platformer with a banger soundtrack.', 'A great game, with great pixel art, fluent combat and AMAZING music.

Sanabi is subversive, therefore it starts out fake, but at a certain point in the story it becomes real. Therefore I must attempt to write a review for this game, despite the fact that there exists no guarantee that a video game review finds its intended audience.\\n\\nTo put it simply, the reason to play Sanabi isn't in the steam description and must be given indirectly. The story of Sanabi involves deep questions which cause it to be a good, authentic, and immersive video game:\\n-What does it mean to be human?\\n-What does it mean to see another as human?\\n-How can you be sure that what you see is reality?\\n-Do memories accurately depict reality?\\n\\nand ideas:\\n-An unfeeling entity that possesses an automatic and unfocused drive to kill\\n-The purpose of one's entire life depending on a single independent concept that, taken by itself, is meaningless\\n-love\\n-and so on and so on\\n\\nSanabi's story is subversive, much like Omori's, which is why the above text seems absurd compared to the summary given on the steam page.

If so, you [b]have[/b] to play this. [b]There\\'s no choice, it\\'s your destiny.[/b]\\n\\nEven if you have learned about LittleBigPlanet 2 (rest in peace, 2011-2021) just now, this game is still amazing.

I think that SANABI is the first 2D game to give me an immense sense of scale.

Some of the examples (spoilers): \\n\\n[spoiler]What is the cleansing chip? Does it erase everything from the \"memory chip\"? What is the Uigeumbu? In-universe it\\'s definitely not the equivalent for the Supreme Court like in the real world. What seemingly impossible feats did the General do during his life? Why does Korea still have a monarchy? Is it absolute? What is the extent of a soldier\\'s augmentation?[/spoiler]\\n\\nI think that therefore the universe is a good fit for some additional games. They don\\'t have to be direct sequels, prequels or even the same genre, just games that take place in the world.\\n\\nHowever, upon further inspection, this game does have some glaring plot holes and contradictions (MAJOR spoilers):\\n\\n[spoiler]Why does the AI-General still have memories of his wife\\'s death together with the ensuing events? Irreversibly deleting them was the very point of Mari\\'s project, so why did they suddenly reappear?[/spoiler]\\n\\n[spoiler]On a related note, why does the AI-General have recordings of research team meetings in his memory?

Great fuel for adrenaline rush\\n- Oh man the [i] music.[/i] Goes super well with the flow and state of the game\\n- Levels can go pretty long in between cutscenes\\n- Great boss fights\\n- Amazing background art and atmosphere\\n- Good characters, although they lean into the tropey side early on\\n\\n[h1] Cons: [/h1]\\n- [spoiler] After knowing the whole story, Mari\\'s actions throughout the game are hard to justify to me [/spoiler]\\n\\n- Voice acting could vastly improve the story experience. The emotional moments do not hit as hard without voice acting. Though I understand the reason why there is no voice acting for a retro-styled game to keep the classic vibe.\\n- You live and die by the grappling hook. Although you get some power-ups to your character and your hook, you literally do not use anything else. Would be nice to have a button to trigger some hacker girl\\'s abilities whenever shes with you for more flexibility and options in gameplay\\n- The cutscenes may break the pace of the game for some people, especially the \"slow walk\" scenes. Imagine the pace of the game going from 100 to 10. Thankfully there are long levels in between major cutscenes.\\n- Very Linear levels, there is zero exploration. I personally prefer some kind of exploration for hidden lore or dialogues, but there is none here\\n- Camera does not pan fast enough sometimes, leading to deaths\\n- Muffin needs more presence in the cutscenes. It is only expressive very early on, the other times it is just a vehicle for Mari\\n\\nTLDR;\\n8/10. Nothing comes as close as capturing vibe of speeding through a 2D neon cyberpunk world as this game, supplemented by an amazing story. Please buy it if you are looking for what I have described, you won\\'t regret it.\\n\\nI will be looking forward to the next game from Wonder Potion. If they could learn from some of the shortcomings from this game, I believe the next game has the potential for a masterpiece.', \"A beautiful narrative, Sanabi's story hit me harder than any game I've played before.\\n\\nThe characters have a lot of depth to them, and Sanabi does a really good job at infusing dialogue and interactions with as much personality as possible, whether through numerous text effects, subtle character animations, or controlling how dialogue advances. I'd like to see this level of detail picked up in other narrative games.\\n\\nFor a long time I thought I'd never see pixel art visuals as gorgeous as Hyper Light Drifter, but just watch the trailer for Sanabi and you'll know it's among the top.\\n\\nThe soundtrack complements the story really well--it's very reflective of the emotions I felt in any given moment while playing the game, and it's cohesive.\\n\\nThe artistic elements of this game (story, art, music) are all through the roof.\\n\\n\\nThe gameplay itself isn't quite on the level of everything else, but it's solid, and this works perfectly fine because the game is very story-driven.\\n\\nMake sure you're not skipping cutscenes or you might as well be throwing your money down the drain.\\n\\n\\n10/10 experience overall\", \"Positives:\\n-Slick presentation with some beautiful scenes and backdrops \\n-Emotional and suspenseful story\\n-Snappy grappling hook platforming action that will definitely appeal to players that like to go fast\\n-Game encourages speedrunning for added replayability \\n-Multiple difficulty levels\\n-Banging OST\\n\\nNegatives:\\n-Lots of typos in dialogue for the English version \\n-Constant story scenes will annoy those that just want to play the game\\n-Tone of the game is rather depressing which some may not vibe with\\n-Upon dying it takes about 5 seconds of staring at a black screen with no audio to respawn. This wouldn't be terrible if it wasn't for some rather tough sections that can lead to a lot of back to back deaths. The audio pausing was probably the most grating aspect tbh since you have this bombastic music playing then it stops for 5 seconds and then it comes back. When this is happening constantly it gets annoying. You may only experience this if you try playing on a higher difficulty like I did. \\n-I experienced some bugs where I was stuck to a wall and had to finagle a bit to get unstuck. There was even a time I glitched through a wall entirely and had to restart at a prior checkpoint to fix. Hopefully the devs can patch this out. \\n-No d-pad control when swinging. \\n\\nDespite all my criticisms this was a very unique and memorable game that I would like to return to at some point. I wholeheartedly recommend it if it looks interesting to you.\", 'A game I REALLY want to like but the more I think back on my time the more I feel like there is a huge wealth of missed potential.\\n\\nThis game demands both speed and precision, however there are numerous pitfalls (metaphorically and VERY literally) that hinder the overall experience. This is almost exclusively because of level design. There is almost always an instant-death pit beneath you, meaning that one minuscule mistake will cause you to restart however you are encouraged to go as fast as you can due to the many timed puzzles and pursuant enemies driving your forward. You can become stunlocked and die with no way to recover and the sheer amount of information you need to be processing in the later levels is nothing short of insane. It\\'s like you\\'re expected to fail just so you can see what\\'s coming up ahead. Once you know what you\\'re meant to be dealing with the game becomes much easier to enjoy as you can actually plan your next moves. As a result I feel like this game would benefit strongly from a slow-down mechanic. Maybe it can be tied to certain actions you perform or simply a button toggle but if I could have had even a second to take a breath and assess my surroundings my frustrations would have almost completely vanished.\\n\\nThe art in this game is beautiful, the music is fantastic and the characters are engaging (although the story does beat you over the head for way longer than it should about certain plot points). When the level design allows it you can really fly through the city and simply enjoy traversal. Heck, even the combat is fun for how sparse it is.\\n\\nHowever there is a specific boss \"fight\" that goes on for FAR too long. It was such a long encounter that there are multiple checkpoints IN the encounter itself, and the difficulty of what you\\'re supposed to do isn\\'t consistent. Some \"cycles\" are nigh-impossible to do in time without knowing what you\\'re dealing with ahead of time while others are so easy you could do them in a wheelchair. And this sporadic difficulty is all over the game, there\\'s no real sense of difficulty progression because the problem is often \"you don\\'t know what\\'s ahead? Better die and figure it out on your second try\". And then when you DO get ahead you have to repeat the process allllllll over again.\\n\\nI think the best way of summarising my feelings is this:\\nInstead of \"cyber Spider-man\" I got \"trial and error: the reckoning\".\\n\\nThere is a good game here, it just wasn\\'t hitting the right notes for me. Too many issues were compounding on one another and the only thing keeping me engaged was the story and character interaction. Despite my frustrations I\\'d say there\\'s more to enjoy than dislike here, even though it seems like I\\'ve done nothing but rant endlessly.', \"this game fucks like a movement based katana zero, but i'm really disappointed that mari holds the objecively wrong opinion about pidgeons, the most wonderful birds on earth.\", \"Editing this review now that I've beaten the full release:\\n\\nThis game is a MASTERPIECE.

To say I was blown away by it would be an understatement, and this game is an easy 10/10 for me.\\n\\nIf you love precision platformers and great music then please play this game as it is worth every penny.

Soundtrack is absolutely bonkers level of tasty synthwave/electronic goodness. EXTREMELY high quality. The pixel art and general spectacle of the game are fantastic. Writing somehow manages to balance grittiness and some level of comic relief without feeling forced or having any \"Well THAT just happened\" moments. The highs are high and might give you a chuckle, and the lows will hit ya right in the gut.\\n\\nLevel design is generally great, with a few small sections that I found a little irritating, but were eventually passed with relative ease on the normal difficulty once I took a moment to step back and put on a momentary cap of thinking for five seconds and actually controlling my movement. Certain sections have a bit of a learning curve, so some levels will rack up the death counter, but if you really dig into the movement mechanics you mechanically feel like a dang superhero by the last few sections of the game. \\n\\nMy best recommendation without spoiling anything is, when you are given the option to rerun the tutorial, do it a handful of times, mess around with the movement, get a feel for the speed and what directional inputs do while you\\'re swinging. I ran the tutorial around 5 or 6 times because it\\'s less than a minute long and I genuinely feel like it enriched my experience with the game.\\n\\nIt\\'s also consistently adding in new little mechanics to make sure that movement never goes stale and ensuring that they tie into that delicious, delicious worldbuilding.\\n\\nThere are difficulty settings across the board from \"You have infinite health and can only die in pits/instant kills, enjoy the story\" to \"A single fart from an enemy kills you\". Also has a speedrun mode that you unlock, presumably after beating the game once. If I had to guess it\\'s probably the levels and bosses in rapid sequence with cutscenes removed.\\n\\nGame is positively dank. As I said, not quite done yet but I\\'m really, REALLY enjoying it.

Un plataformer 2d con mecánicas novedosas y que no se estancan nunca, siempre te da algo nuevo con lo que poder jugar sin salir de la mecánica principal del juego. La música es simplemente maravillosa es totalmente inmersiva y no desentona nada con su estética cyberpunk lograda excelentemente con un pixel art hermoso. Decir que Sanabi es un buen juego se queda corto, todo lo que rodea a este juego fue horneado con el cariño extremo y esto se ve en la historia tan bella que nos plantea, Yo quería entretenerme balanceándome por una ciudad, no llorar por una historia tan bien hecha. Es un juego que definitivamente debes jugar y creo que hasta supera su inspiración Katana Zero que tambien es un JUEGAZO. JUEGUENLO, COMPRENLO, ES HERMOSO', 'This game has very tight platforming mechanics and some of the best-feeling 2D grappling hook traversal I\\'ve ever seen. However, the good news does not end there. Here is a bulleted list of what I liked about this game:\\n\\n1. A compelling mystery plot.\\n2. A very moving character story-line with heartfelt emotional moments\\n3. A lot of humor and charm.\\n4. Set piece action sequences with a grand scale.\\n5. The details. There are so many cute, funny, referential details throughout the game.\\n6. Animations - Despite being relatively small sprites, their animations convey a lot of emotion.\\n\\nThis is a game where I kept finding myself saying \"Whoa.\" Because there are a lot of BIG moments in the game and every one of them is set up so beautifully and masterfully. The game does a great job of building tension leading up to each major mystery reveal or epic action sequence.\\n\\nStop reading this, you should already be installing by now!', \"This was a very enjoyable experience, especially for early access. The controls feel smooth for the most part though there are some areas where the grappling felt stiff mostly when turning some corners. Combat felt awesome, dashing around from enemy to enemy felt satisfying and while simple there were some mechanics that can make things interesting. Being able to dash after being hit is a nice recovery option and I can't wait to see how speedrunners abuse this tactic. You can go really fast in this game and swinging around felt fun, though I hope to see a little more enemy variety in the full version. The final boss was definitely the biggest highlight of the game for me. All of the other bosses were great as well but I felt this one definitely will test your grappling skills the most.\\n\\nThe story and characters were nicely written. The story goes from seemingly cheerful to dark pretty fast and early on. I like the concept of the world, with it being some sort of cyberpunk Korean setting with shadowy corporate conspiracies. The characters have enough charm to keep things from being overly mopey, and the game throws in cute references and doesn't take itself too seriously but manages to keep you invested in what's going on. The character designs were also good. One of my favorites was the Gun Head boss encountered at the beginning of the game. The look of the city is fantastic, though I wish there was a little more variety in terms of level aesthetic.\\n\\nAs someone who is eager for the Katana Zero dlc I feel this game was able to scratch that itch while also being able to retain a distinct identity on its own. The comparisons were inevitable, and while it doesn't quite strike the same chords I feel that SANABI is on its way to becoming something great and I look forward to playing the finished version when it comes around.\", \"[h1]Check out my video coverage of the game: [/h1] \\n\\nhttps://youtu.be/p1tpb8R4mzE\\n\\n[h1]Written Review[/h1]\\n\\nSANABI is going to scratch that fast-paced platformer itch you've had for the past few months. You play as the retired army general on the path of vengeance. Attached to your shoulder is the Chain Arm - part weapon, part grappling hook that you use to not only swing around the dystopian cyberpunk streets of Mago city, set in Korea. The Chain Arm is also used to...\\n\\n*checks notes*\\n\\n...rip enemies apart in an instant.\\n\\nThis is a one-hit kill platformer that makes you feel powerful when you pull off a sick move, and like an absolute loser when you whiff it. Speedrunners rejoice - this is the one you're looking for. There are various tools to traverse the environment, boosting through swings with your Chain Arm at the right moment will propel you to the next area in a single swift move. Memorizing the environment will make it even easier to chain your movement from zone to zone quickly.\\n\\nWhich is a bit of a shame because...the environment is beautiful. Mago city is full of neon lights, industrial corridors, and beautifully-designed robots both friend and foe. The game gives massive Katana ZERO vibes, with the fast-paced nature of Super Meat Boy and similar wall-jumping platformers in the genre - all wrapped up in tasty cyberpunk vibes.\\n\\nThere are some minor graphical issues in some of the cinematics, and there were TINY but noticible performance issues I while playing. But this review was made literally hours after the game's early access release so there's still time to tune these things up.\\n\\nI have a lot to play and experience in Sanabi so far, but if you're a fan of fast-paced platformers like Katana ZERO and Super Meat Boy then you're really going to like this one.\", 'Sanabi is as satisfying to play as it looks, boldly making another case for the ol\\' question: \"Does a grappling hook make every game better?\". In the case of this cyberpunk platformer, the answer is yes. Drawing heavy visual and storytelling inspiration from the fantastic Katana: Zero, Sanabi is a story about transhumanism, capitalism, trauma, and family. While in some cases the anti-capitalist nature of the story comes off as ham-fisted especially as it conflicts with its seemingly pro-militarist narrative, the game is at all times tongue-in-cheek with it\\'s delivery of this message (there is a painting of Elon Musk in one of the levels). Aside from thematic criticism, the writing in Sanabi is occasionally muddied by what is clearly haphazard translation from Korean to English, but this is a criticism specific to the English version and I can\\'t speak for other versions of the game. Overall I thought the writing was very good, with good dramatic and comedic timing, so this is more of a nitpick than anything. I highly recommend this game for people looking for a fast-paced platformer with a good story, good art, and satisfying movement mechanics.', \"This was one of the greatest games I've ever played. Probably the most fluid and fun movement mechanics I've ever seen in a 2D platformer, amazing boss fights, incredible music, the pixel art is probably the best I've ever seen in a video game and the story is one of the most emotional and impactful I've ever experienced. Game was about 9 hours long for me on Hard difficulty and the quality stays high that whole time, there's no point where it drops off, which is insane given the quality of the animation in every scene. It has a ton of wit and charm, I genuinely love this game. All of that AND it has a grappling hook. Do yourself a favor and just buy the game as soon as you physically can\", \"I bought the game during early access, but wanted to wait until the campaign was fully fleshed out and finished. The waiting paid off and the release is truly a wonderfully executed, finished game.\\n\\nAs great as the music, the art style and the combat is - I'm mostly happy that the developers stuck the landing on the campaign and delivered an amazing story that quite frankly is even better than Katana Zero's. It hit me in the feels like KZ didn't.\\n\\nA lot of comparisons with Katana Zero have been made - in a very positive sense ofc, but now having finished the game I can honestly say, that the comparisons should probably stop. Yes, the music and the art style is just as great, but apart from that Sanabi stands on its own. It has it's own unique gameplay, that is far closer to Celeste than Katana Zero. Traversing levels at 'high octane' speeds and killing enemies along the way has a very different feel compared to KZ. The boss fights are all unique and fun. The difficulty is even on Veteran mostly fair. There were one or two passages in Chapter 3 or 4 where the next checkpoint was a little bit too far away and you had to repeat 'a little bit' too much for my taste but otherwise it was a great experience. \\n\\nWhat is also interesting to note is, that the further you get in the campaign, the more abilities you unlock and the more fun (!) traversing levels actually becomes. I thought that was quite a feat, because usually the further you get in a game the more difficult and frustrating it simply gets - this is somewhat true for Sanabi as well, but trust me, you will have the best time in the game when you blast through the last chapter with all your abilities unlocked.  What a great finale and feeling, when you reach the ending!\\n\\nUh yeah, so.... recommended! In fact..a tie for Game of the Year for me (with BG3 and Dave the diver)\", 'If you haven’t already, look at the other reviews. They’re probably far shorter than this review, more elegant, and, above all, far more humorous. But most of them share the same point:\\n\\nThat this game is phenomenal, in so, so many ways, and one that you shouldn’t miss. \\n\\nThe grapple hook is done extremely well here, and, with the other mechanics it introduces, makes you feel like a boss as you zip across the screen, killing enemies with crunchy sound effects and a badass soundtrack.\\n\\nThe story starts off pretty simple, but, at least for me, it was quite engaging (hey, maybe I don’t have taste, I don’t know). But as it unravels, there are twists that completely table the turns and a satisfying ending that blows your socks off and leaves you hungry for more (yeah, it’s satisfying, but as soon as it ended, I was like “that’s it?”). I heard that the developers were making DLC, which I hope is true, and really hope is coming soon. \\n\\nThe characters here are great too, and, throughout a game, you really do feel a connection to them. Mari serves as a great side character, adding humor to the game and strengthening its many serious moments. \\n\\nI do have a minor nitpick with this game, which is when you fall off a cliff or die. When you die, the music completely stops, it pauses for a few seconds, and then you start back at a checkpoint. It kills the flow of the game and I feel it would have been better if the game involved quicker deaths and allow you to get back into it faster (according to my memory, it did this for ONE BOSS FIGHT, and I frankly wish it did this for the whole game. I did do this on normal mode, and didn’t try it on legendary or other difficulties. The pause button also speeds things up a bit, although it still pause the music and you still have to wait).\\n\\nRegardless, this is just one small blemish on a masterfully crafted painting, and it beats out most 59.99 and now 69.99 games out there (for the sweet, sweet price of 14.99).\\n\\nSo just get it.', \"Ok, for starters if you enjoy platformers go no further and get this game.\\n\\nFor people that might still be on the fence let me tell you why you should buy Sanabi.\\n- Incredible pixel art\\n- Engaging story\\n- The smoothest platforming\\n- Amazing bossfights and combat mechanics\\n- Great music\\nAnd the list could go on for much longer.\\n\\nWhat I'm trying to say is play the game, you won't regret it one bit.\", '10/10 Story.\\n10/10 Art.\\n9/10 Gameplay.\\nIt should be noted that the game is currently unfinished, and temporarily ends on a cliffhanger.', 'Great art, interesting story, and good gameplay.', \"IF YOU'RE READING THIS and haven't spoiled the game yet, I would reccomend not looking any further and just playing the game.\\n\\nvery fast paced and satisfying platformer that doesn't have its skill cap hinged on just being insanely difficult like that other game everyone keeps mentioning.\\n\\ngreat story with a lot of excellent pixel art animation and a great soundtrack.\\n\\nbest played with a mouse and keyboard, I highly reccomend this game\", 'Came for the grappling stayed for the emotionally smart driven story that says a lot about society.', 'Oynadığım en iyi pixel art oyunlardan biri oldu.

Sanabi is an incredible cyberpunk action platformer with tight controls and a rich story. Taking obvious influence from Katana Zero, the combat and controls in this game are easy to learn and fun to master. By the end of the story, you're blasting through each level and it feels so satisfying. I really appreciated the lack of rankings and collectibles to better focus on the incredible story. I truly did not anticipate the twists and turns this game brought, but even more-so how the story stayed easy to follow. I was never truly lost on what was going on in the story, any more than the games narrative was intentionally pacing itself for. The pixel art in this game is just gorgeous. Each area has a distinct art style separating it from the last and SEVERAL screenshot worthy stills presented by the story. The soundtrack is littered with the main theme which is always a treat to hear weaved into hard synth tracks all the way into the more somber tracks. There are also several moments of humor that were always in good taste and never skipped a beat to present them.\\n\\nThis game truly is a 10/10 for me. It masters tight controls, great storytelling, beautiful visuals, & atmospheric music all into a very reasonable price for the length of the story (~12 hours).

It's almost a shame to put such a fun game mechanic in such a story-heavy game. \\nThere's a few moments of bad level design (some jumps that you need to make offscreen with little to no indicator that that's where you need to go) and the pacing really drags during the middle, but it has a rewarding ending so overall I'd say it's worth it. Whatever this studio does next I'll be checking out. \\nTL;DR this game spend half of its time ruling and the other half of the time playing like a visual novel, and both parts work well in a vacuum but together they tend to clash.

There are people who will love this game as much as I do and people who will find a flaw to fixate on and let it ruin their enjoyment of it.

Don't spoil yourself, but trust that the developers did that deliberately so that they could play with it later to create a very good story when all's said and done.\", \"An excellent action-platformer based around a grappling hook.  Controls are occasionally wonky, but it plays pretty well overall.  The best part is the story though, which is mysterious and intriguing while still managing to tie everything up in a beautifully emotional ending.  I won't forget this one for quite some time.\", \"Excellent action platformer with an interesting story and beautiful art. It's a little slow to take off and kinda story-heavy at the beginning for my taste, but I was happy that I kept playing.\", \"Well, I just beat the game and I have to say. This was probably one of the most unique experiences I've had in a game in a LONG TIME. Everything from the story, to the music and the gameplay was so wonderful. My only complaint I have is with one of the aspects of the gameplay, getting stun locked and dying in those DAMN RED BOX DANGER ZONES, it really kinda broke the flow of the gameplay, if you get caught in them the knockback from taking damage knocks you back into them making it impossible to get out of it and just ends up killing you. So yeah that;s my only complaint though. Everything else was PERFECT. The story had a twist I didn't see coming even with the constant hints they kept dropping to me. The story will really make your heart throb. The game does have some slight Katana ZERO vibes but I honestly found this game a lot more enjoyable compared to Katana ZERO overall. This game is a MUST PLAY!\", \"I'd been looking for a new game to play for a while, and when I saw SANABI on the store page, its visuals and story setting immediately drew my attention. I had never heard of it before, but seeing the overwhelmingly positive review score, I decided to listen to what seemed to be the general consensus and go in blind. Now, after having finished the game, I absolutely agree with the sentiment. The story in this game is deep and emotional, and full of twists and turns. I can't, in good faith, say more than that, and if you have any interest at all in this game, go in completely blind. The gameplay revolves around your grappling hook arm, and features a lot of aerial movement. The game provides a decent challenge, and has incredibly fun and fluid movement that makes it feel good to go fast and pull off tricks, or just finish certain more difficult sections. The controls are responsive, and you can feel your momentum carry over in your movement without feeling too floaty. The combat in the game is an extension of the movement system, and fighting enemies furthers the momentum instead of bringing the gameplay to a halt. The pixel art is nothing short of beautiful, with several unique and cinematic locations and backgrounds. I will say, the English translation isn't perfect, and there are some lines that don't quite make sense and need to be read over more than once, but it was still very understandable and didn't really hamper my enjoyment of the story. I would absolutely recommend the game, especially if you like platformers, pixel art, and crying over said pixel art.\", \"Holy hell this game is good. I honestly can't think of a single thing wrong with it  The gameplay is the most fun I've had in a game like this in such a long time.

This game capitalizes on both, having some of the most fun combat AND platforming of any game I've ever played. How does it achieve this? The protagonist's signature chain arm and other movement abilities, beyond being cool as heck, give the player unrestricted freedom over exactly where they need to go, how fast they need to get there, whether they need invincibility frames when getting there, etc. Pretty much any mistake or screw-up in this game is entirely the player's fault, while every success is a result of the player's skill, and adds to the feeling of flow the game allows. There's no better feeling than being able to breeze through multiple checkpoints in a row without dying or falling out of the map. \\n\\nThe game offers different difficulty options for different people based on the experience they want (ex: I would imagine someone wanting to experience the story alone would probably pick Easy, where your character doesn't take damage, while people who want a challenging experience may pick Veteran(hard) or Legend(one HP)), so players have some level of control over their experience.  \\n\\nAs for the actual content in the game itself, the game is roughly 15 hours long with 5 levels. Each level has a different setting, platforming mechanics, BGM (this game has a really good soundtrack), and enemies. While different, all of these levels are fun and enable a player to achieve the flow state I was discussing earlier. The last level in particular is what I believe to be the best level I've ever played through in a video game in terms of mechanics, writing, and pure fun factor. Furthermore, there are a number of bosses spread throughout the game, all of which are fair, look pretty cool, and are a blast to fight. \\n\\nVisuals: well, you've seen the trailers. The game looks gorgeous, with a beautiful pixel-crafted world that encapsulates the futuristic city we all imagined in our heads. The game uses visuals well, never being too overbearing and never taking away from the gameplay while perfectly telling the story of the place you're in. Furthermore, animations are solid as well, making the protagonist look cool as the player platforms through these levels while ripping apart every enemy in sight. \\n\\nFor the game's plot, I won't say anything except that it's really good. The plot centers around two characters, and their interactions throughout the game made me smile, laugh, and tear up at different points throughout the game. If you like a story with well written characters, play this game.\\n\\nIt's a great game, and you should definitely play it, especially if you like action platformers like Katana ZERO.\", 'AMAZING 10/10 story, gameplay, pixel arts', \"When starting out the game I thought it was just a good ole fashion Father on a raging vengeance for his cute Daughter with a Katana Zero vibe and a funny grapple hook.

HAHAH IM NOT SAD YOU ARE :_:\", 'SANABI is a 2D platformer focused on grapple hook based gameplay alongside a banging soundtrack and a particularly enjoyable story. The feel of each grapple mechanic was great and the level design was quite intuitive overall.

Would be a 10/10 if not for the fact that several segments very much outstay their welcome (tutorial, factory, that kinda deal)', 'Its a good game. Excellent platformer, gameplay is a blast, beautiful pixel art, the history can be a little bit cliche sometimes but its catchy and fun.  Play it. Its worth it.', \"Sanabi, a game that opens with lovely visuals and an intriguing plot, leading into a beautiful story, breathtaking scenes, and really fun platforming, with a killer soundtrack to boot. \\n\\nI'm in tears, What an incredible example of Games as an art, I cannot recommend it enough.\", 'Loved this game from start to finish. Amazing feel to movement, great visuals and a heartwarming story. Love this game. It had a couple annoying moments, the most annoying one being the helicopter boss, but it is nothing in comparisson to how great the game was.', \"8.2/10 Highly recommend; however, if the game had ended in the first half, I would have rated it significantly lower. The gameplay picks up a noticeable amount and the story really starts to come together meaningfully. Though it's worth powering through some of the more annoying parts to experience the last few hours of the game, getting to the end is not what's important...\", 'Sanabi has absolutely beautiful pixel art/animation and a story I enjoyed.\\n\\nI did however find it pretty difficult starting about halfway through the game, even after kicking the difficulty down to easy. Some sequences and bosses became very frustrating after numerous failed attempts. The pacing of the game (especially late game) is also hurt by the jerky stop and go between gameplay and story cutscenes, which is only partially alleviated by the quality of the story.\\n\\nThat said, it is a title I would recommend.', 'Great game. The platforming is fun yet challenging, while the game allows for adjustments in the difficulty for people who might find it to difficult, or too easy. However, more precise controls seem to be quite hard to pull off. The story, while not without its flaws, is great and heartwarming. The artstyle is pleasing as well. All in all, great game.', \"The Overwhelmingly Positive rating is well deserved. Originally, I was getting the impression this was a mid platformer with some nice graphics, but the game manages to stay fresh with each new area introducing one or two new mechanics which are combined well with previous ones. I would say you can tell by the 2nd area or so if this game is for you. I won't focus much on the positives here are my negatives:\\n\\n- The early story is sloooow. Not a slog, just slow, with more than a couple walking segments. I can see this would put off a lot of people from otherwise fast paced game unfortunately, but it only happens near the beginning.\\n\\n- The mystery of the story takes a while to start resolving, but by the time it does start, you kind of already know what the answers are going to be. Not to say it's unoriginal, but the themes have been tread before. That being said, I really like how this game's story plays out. I was interested all the way through to figure out what is going on. Some minor things are confusing at the end, and I spotted more than 1 plot hole, but it's nothing major.\\n\\n- There is a gauntlet at the end. The game has frequent saves so it's not a gameplay problem, but you're running through areas you've already been to, which is always annoying to me. Thankfully it is a lot faster this time around. That reminds me,\\n\\n- Levels are quite long some times. I finished in 9.8 hrs, and I played in one day in one sitting (because I really wanted to see how story pans out) so probably closer to 7 hours. On one hand, there is a lot of gameplay here, but at the same time a lot of that gameplay is the same mechanic throughout a level. It's not that the character is slow or anything either, the levels just start to drag at some point, especially Chapter 3 levels.\\n\\n- The boss near the end is annoyingly hard. I don't even know if I want to come back and do Legendary because of how annoying that boss was to fight.\\n\\nOverall, I will say the mystery and theme carries this game more than the gameplay. The gameplay is nice but I can easily see how it can feel padded or samey and boring. Unlike Katana Zero, if the game starts easy for you, it ends feeling just as easy. But if this isn't a deal breaker for you, it's a good game. Just a really well put together game with a really good story.\", \"Revising my review to grant it a perfect 10/10 score. I now consider this game to be my favorite platformer.\\n\\nTo start off, the story is amazing. It's hard to find games nowadays with such a solid story which is not only captivating but had me constantly thinking about what is to come next even when I wasn't playing the game.\\n\\nCharacters are fleshed out, expressive, and you really end up feeling a connection with each and every core character that are introduced.\\n\\nThe developers deserve a big round of applause for creating such an immersive environment despite the game being limited to pixel art. All the environments are unique, and it felt like I was looking at a piece of art. I often found myself pausing in awe at the breathtaking landscapes, which further enhanced my immersion in the game. You can tell that a lot of love and effort has gone into this game.\\n\\nGameplay was also fantastic. Mechanics continued to evolve, boss fights were unique and exciting, mob diversity kept things interesting, and anything that initially felt redundant proved to have significant meaning later, which made me appreciate the game that much more.\\n\\nAll in all, this indie game surpassed my expectations by far, and out-shined many of the recent AAA game releases. I strongly recommend purchasing the game, especially given its price but the content it comes with, you really can't go wrong.\\n\\nSuper happy that I decided to give this game a try. What a masterpiece.\", \"I've been on Steam for 15 years and I think this is the first serious review I write for a game I bought. I expected to have fun, I expected gorgeous pixel art animation, I expected really good art direction, I expected really good music and I expected sphincter tightening action.\\n\\nWhat I didn't expect was to cry like a little bitch. Sanabi is easily the best game I've played in 2023 and in my top 5 of games I've played since 2020. It's just that good. I beg of you, please support this developper. They have done some truly masterful work that would put any major studios to shame and they deserve a lot more recognition. I sincerely hope we see more of WONDER POTION in the future.\", 'Its rare to find an impactful indie game that is both very fun to progress through both from a narrative and a gameplay perspective. I absolutely loved the gameplay with the simple yet satisfying chain-swinging and feeling like a BAMF when you start getting better and fly through rooms tearing everything in your way.\\n\\nDid not expect to start crying like a ***** though. 9/10. A beautiful experience from start to end.', 'the game is so sad yet so wholesome, it has amazing pixel art and a sad story and the movement is fluid', \"A action platformer that's centered around swinging and attacking with a chain arm. I died a handful of times due to my clumsy maneuvering and screwing things up, so there's a bit of punch to the game's difficulty that I appreciate. This game was at it's peak when you get into a flow state and start to zip through the puzzle elements and enemies. So, there's a lot of skill to be tested in your execution of chain grabs and swinging and probably dozens of hours for people who get hooked on speed running or replaying on the highest difficulty.\\n\\nFinally, I'll give credit where it's due for story. It took a while for me to warm up to it, but eventually the plot builds up towards some pretty emotional moments that feel well earned. First impressions felt corny but I certainly wouldn't drop the game if the story doesn't affect you, because the game itself is quite good.\", \"tl;dr - good game, 9/10, scratches the katana zero itch very well, plot is likely to be something you're invested in once you've played for a bit.\\n\\nLong version:\\nGot onto my radar from a friend who had wishlisted it when we were swapping games we were interested in that were releasing soon/had released recently - must say, didn't disappoint - this scratched the itch Katana Zero left me with perfectly and I think has forever ruined games with grappling hooks for me now.\\n\\nGameplay wise:\\nI have a few gripes with one specific segment in the factory, and a couple of the hazard layouts in the final levels - but overall have no complaints outside of those.\\n\\nStory wise:\\nFuck man, I wasn't expecting what happened. Those reviews saying that its hard to play through the tears are right.\\nVague spoilers in the box for general plot [spoiler] Started off fairly generic with the revenge plot, got a bit weird when I noticed a musk stand-in, had a few moments where I went ???? because Mari or Mister acted out of character for what they'd displayed so far but I assumed that was a translation thing. Some of them probably still are a translation thing - but a good chunk of them are actually wrapped up towards/at the end of the game and aren't out of character so much as not fully explained yet because you don't have the full picture and couldn't have until that point.

I almost quit the game because I was tired of it getting its own way. How many times is this game going to stop me in the middle of an intense grappling hook section to dump more talking heads in my lap?\\n\\nBut I'm glad I stuck with because the payoff is more than worth it. \\n\\nThe grappling hook goodness, the surprisingly gripping story, the gorgeous and emotive pixel art that makes the characters come alive more than a lot of AAA games, and one of the best video game soundtracks ever recorded -- this game has so much going for it. \\n\\nHighly, highly recommended\", 'very fluid fast-paced grappling hook movement. great story, awesome music, and amazing pixel art.', 'Brainfart', 'I love this game, I had just finished Katana Zero when I stumbled upon this game and everyone said \"if you liked Katana Zero then you\\'ll like this\".

And the story is the same to the extent where both are about a power larger than you that is going to have you sitting on the edge of your seats wanting to get to the end. The story overall is still significantly different than that of Katana Zero. The game play is quite different too. It is much more platform based than Katana zero and for the most part has zero time dilation. If you played Katana Zero, you will like this game.

May the song play on.', 'Gameplay is silky smooth and the story is riveting and heartbreaking, excellent game for anyone who enjoys story-rich games and/or platformers like Katana Zero', \"\\n[h3] Gameplay: [/h3] \\nThe combat in Sanabi is inspired by 'Katana Zero' -- with the most obvious change from its combat being the swing mechanic. Swinging around always feels satisfying when pulled off, and means that you are always moving and swinging throughout the levels that have been carefully designed for that movement, but can feel finicky at times especially since it is such an unconventional mechanic and takes a while to get used to. The difficulty is also trying to mirror that of 'Katana Zero' and scales exceedingly well as the game progresses and different enemy types and complications to the game are added a a pace that keeps the gameplay interesting while not becoming overwhelming. The controls also work well on both on controller and mouse and keyboard since it allows you to you your cursor to aim which is refreshing seeing as most 2D platfromers on PC have pretty mediocre controls. The game also has a harder unlockable difficulty and a speedrunner mode and due to its short length of 9 hours is replayable, but don't expect to be playing it over and over again since most of the main fluff of the game is in that first playthrough. The length of the game also means that it doesn't overstay its welcome and means that each enemy encounter feels meaningful and fun.\\n\\n[h3] Visuals: [/h3] \\n'Sanabi' has gorgeous visuals that mix real-time lighting and fog with beautiful pixel art that blends well with the fast-paced combat that needs that clear visual clarity. The game will constantly pan over vast beautiful cityscapes that set the atmosphere for the game and act as a moment of reflection in between the intense combat sections and are an absolute joy to look at. \\n\\n[h3] Story: [/h3] \\n Sanabi's story is a mystery thriller with a captivating and engaging story that leads to some genuinely jaw-dropping moments, but is tainted with annoying characters and a weak ending. I found the secondary main character 'Mari' pretty frustrating, with lines that are distracting in serious moments and unfunny in the calmer ones. It also does have different endings according to your choices but it isn't a big aspect of the game. Only one choice affects the ending, and one of the endings is essentially just a cutscene, which feels like a waste of an opportunity. The longer, more fleshed-out ending didn't click with me as much as I would have liked, and felt like it wasn't the ending the game had been building up to.\\n\\n[h3] Music: [/h3] \\nSanabi's music is excellent, having adrenaline-pumping tracks with boss tracks being especially exhilarating and more serene slower-paced tracks that stick in your head long after you've beaten the game.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Sanabi can stand as its own next to the games that inspired it such as Celeste, Katana Zero, and Hotline Miami through its exceptional music, gameplay, visuals, and story and should get more of the recognition it deserves.\", \"SANABI's a great game. Possibly my favourite out of every one I've played this year, and I play a lot of them.\\nIt's partially because the game makes me feel like I'm absolutely busted at it, but also because the controls, mechanics, and story are incredibly tight. And fun.\\n\\nThe game's introduction of new mechanics are paced excellently; its core gameplay loop is enjoyable almost regardless of what level of the skill spectrum you land on; the story is intriguing in both themes and its beats, dropping just enough hints that a player is capable of solving its mysteries incredibly early while still remaining fuelled with a jet-fuel level of emotional oomph that'll keep the player pushing to the end.\\nIt's very, very good.\\n\\nThe only real criticism I have is on what is (technically) the final boss, whose mechanics are obscure in a way that encourages experimentation but tended to just leave me baffled. I'm still not sure why my shift would get blocked at some moments.\\nThat's literally my only criticism. I'd recommend this to anyone at all who even mildly enjoys platformers, and it's the cost of 1-3 burgers and I'd wager almost any PC can run it. Give it a go\", \"A lot of people are comparing this game to Katana Zero. As someone who seriously loved Katana Zero, I have to say, this game feels much better and complete. However, movement and platforming is the focus and combat is secondary.\\n\\nI can think of very minor issues coming from this game. One is the sort of whiplash you get with constant switching back and forth from gameplay and cutscenes. \\n\\nWhen you are having a lot of fun playing, the game stops you and has you experience a cutscene. \\nWhen you are excited by story progression, a new mystery is brought up, and becomes a cliffhanger that is interrupted by gameplay.\\n\\nThey don't want to info dump on you, but they kind of mess up the pace. A bunch of conversations investigate one idea and then for one reason or another, they have to drop the conversation and start running again. \\n\\nIt takes time for the story to get good because the main character is deadpan rude and does not allow conversations to progress very far.

Later, recently in fact, my computer died, right after I had found out that Sanabi had been finished. I was excited because I had written this game off as one doomed to never be updated again, liek so many others, but here it was.\\nI won't spoil any of the story because it's best experienced, but I will tell you, this is a high flying, swinging adventure through a doomed city... and that getting to the end isn't what's important... it's how you get there.\", \"An honest review of SANABI - \\n\\nSANABI is undeniably captivating, weaving a tale of intense gameplay and immersive storytelling. Although, there are some setbacks to it. \\n\\nGameplay and Visual Charm:\\nSANABI's gameplay is a thrilling escapade, offering a challenging platformer that has its difficulty with a lot excitement. The 2D pixel art style, reminiscent of Celeste, adds a nostalgic touch, creating a visually compelling environment. The *initial* playthrough is a delightful rollercoaster, with engaging mechanics that set it apart from other games.\\n\\nReplay Value:\\nWhile SANABI looks fun for another round, its charm begins to disappear upon replaying. The story really loses its charm, it's just not interesting after you know the ending, and the achievements, omg. The achievements that are left after completing the game are some of the hardest ones. \\n\\nChallenges and Achievements:\\nSANABI introduces a commendable level of difficulty, reaching its zenith in the formidable Legend mode. However, the pursuit of achievements becomes a double-edged sword as the overwhelming challenge, particularly in beating the game on Legend mode, can deter even the most determined players. The lofty difficulty may alienate those seeking a more laid-back gaming experience, impacting the game's accessibility.\\n\\nCutscene Overload:\\nA notable drawback lies in SANABI's reliance on cutscenes, disrupting the harmony between storytelling and gameplay. The engaging storyline is occasionally overshadowed by an almost 50/50 split between cutscenes and interactive play. This imbalance, disrupts the game's rhythm and could potentially remove the amount of overall enjoyment. \\n\\nTime:\\nIt's really a short game, sadly. It's only got about 8 hours worth of gameplay, and like I said, it's about half cutscenes. I really loved this game, but it only being 8 hours really deterred me from it. If it were lengthier, I'd definitely rate it better than I will soon.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nSANABI stands as a commendable piece of indie gaming, offering an enthralling platformer with a narrative that initially captivates. However, the overabundance of cutscenes and the super difficult achievements in the latter part of the game pose hurdles to its long-term appeal. Nonetheless, for those seeking an adrenaline-pumping and challenging gaming experience, especially during the initial joyride, SANABI remains a solid choice. It IS worth the cost, 100%, 8/10 game.\", 'great story\\n\\ngame play is very fun but their are some annoying bits\\n\\nmusic and art is great', \"It's hard to put into words how I feel about this game.

The game was a 6~7 for me personally. It's a fast paced platformer with good pixel art and great gameplay. Controls are super responsive, levels are great and reward fast and aggressive play, soundtrack really stands out. It has some solid set pieces, and really ramps up tension for boss fights. Although the introduction was slow and boring, as soon as I got to the first real level, I thought this game might hold me over until Earthblade comes out. The thought ended about 20-30 minutes later.\\n\\nI do recommend this game on the gameplay and music alone. However, at least for me, it can't stand among the greats because of its presentation and writing.\\n\\nSpoilers for the first 30 minutes of the game that provide some additional context for my criticisms\\n[spoiler]\\nYour daughter dies at the beginning of the game, and the game goes edgelord immediately. Then 30 minutes in you'll meet another young girl who will accompany you and the game loses that tone immediately.\\n\\nThe story wants to drive a father + surrogate daughter narrative like the Last of Us Part 1, complete with the daughter figure being naive and cracking jokes. \\n\\nThe problem is, as you might expect, the quality of the writing and the characters is not good enough to make you care about the characters. Poor writing does impact the whole product negatively, but it would be a minor issue if the gameplay was the biggest priority. The problem is that the bad writing is given the same focus as the gameplay, and it got in the way of me having fun.\\n[/spoiler]\\n\\nEvery problem snowballs from here:\\n* The actual time it takes to scroll through text is WAY too long. The developers want to animate every line, but the cues are off and it takes 2-3 seconds to just get to the next line. This was a fatal flaw for me. The story constantly interrupted the gameplay, and I couldn't speed read past it,\\n* The quality of the writing is mixed, and pretty bad overall, at least it was in Japanese (I couldn't stand the English localization). It has its moments, but the sheer amount of time you spend in conversation gets in the way of the game's biggest strengths, its gameplay and music.\\n* The high quality pixel art in the first level shows what the game could have, but the second level is an industrial area made up of monotone browns that lack detail, and one boss is rendered as a 3D model whereas the other bosses are rendered with pixels. This shift in quality betrays the stellar visual presentation of the first section of the game, which is problematic because at this point I'm irritated with the dialogue. In the first section, having gorgeous visuals softened the blow.  The game makes up for this with strong art and presentation in the second half, however. \\n* Speaking of which, given the talent that the artists have, I don't understand why they decided to tell instead of show most of the story. The animations are fluid and gorgeous, but they play out mostly during dialogue, which is a waste.\\n* The final chapter of the game ties up the story and has really great gameplay, but it also has the most dialogue and some of it is unskippable. Also (minor spoiler) [spoiler]there's no final boss, the game instead closes on story beats. I don't know what could be a more fitting end to this review where my biggest complaint is that the story gets in the way of the gameplay[/spoiler] \\n* Last issue is minor. The game isn't hard and I wish the 1HKO difficulty was unlocked from the start.\\n\\n\\nI like this game, I recommend it, but I don't love it. There's a ton of talent and skill behind this game, which makes it all the more frustrating to see it get in its own way with poor presentation. Now I'm looking at Tevi as the next thing to calm me down for the long wait til Earthblade's release.\", \"Very good game, especially as a speed game. \\n\\nMechanically the game can be a tad finicky for anyone starting off, especially since there haven't been that many hook games in some time. Last I remember was Grapple Force Rena, but that was significantly slower. Otherwise, once you get used to it and start picking up speed it gets pretty fast in a hurry. Otherwise, the one ability that is a bit finicky to use is the charge dash, but it's not TOO bad\\n\\nMain issue that the game can have is the abundance of cut scenes and slow walking. Some cut scenes are unskippable, which can get annoying for folk doing multiple playthroughs, and during the slow walking segments it's hard to tell what's a cut scene and what isn't.\\n* Since Speedrun mode isn't out yet, we don't have that yet for proper practice or anything, but that should be resolved soon.\\n\\nMusic is great. Not much to really say there they all fit their situations. The Long Voyage was great.\\n\\nStory is pretty strong, even if the translation is not the greatest. Typos, grammar issues, sometimes using the incorrect words entirely. Hopefully they can fix that all soon for future players.\\n\\nAll in all, good vidya. Play it.\", \"Great game.

From the wonderful art styling, to the great soundtrack (and perffect use of silence), to the teeth clenching game play, to the tear inducing story.  I would like to thank everyone that worked on Sanabi, you all created something truly wonderful.', \"Honestly one of the best platformers I have ever played (definitely one of the best I have played in years) and was really excited when the full release came out after playing early access last year, the pacing of the gameplay including great implication of puzzles elevate this game to the same level as other greats like celeste. Honestly recommend it to all my friends that love platformers. The caste of characters are all bubbly and have great dialogue and the art is katana zero level of good. For me its definitely a 9/10 and as the developers work on improving the game it will definitely reach 10/10. It is already a staple for me in the genre and in indie games in general so I will always sings it praises. so if you continue to read my review know that my critique for the game is from a place of love and I really recommend this game.\\n\\nHowever there are two problems that I hope the developers due read in my review that I hope they will address, one minor and one I think is pretty major\\nThe Minor problem is the lack of a break in certain sections, for example without going into spoilers, there is was a part in the game where you encounter three set pieces (major action parts/boss fights) that happen one after another. The player is unable to find a suitable moment to exit the game without feeling that if he quits now he would it would ruin the experience in some sort of way. What do I mean by this? Well after the set piece ends the player immediately enters a cut scene that he is unable to pause and save than safely exit, he would only be able to pause the game after he skips the cutscene (which why would you? the cut scenes are great) or allow it to play out. Now for most this might not be such a bad thing, it just means there is just a lot of exciting and cool events in the game that can make a player play for hours. However not every player is like that and most times after a major set piece especially after a boss fight would normally save and exit the game. So it is not to start the next part of the game. Now you can save and exit after the cutscene but I feel like if a player came back the next week to play the game he or she would forget the context of the major set piece he or she was playing in therefore slightly hindering the experience. What I propose is before a cutscene starts (one that leads to the next boss fight or event) after a major set piece that the player must first interact with Marie than does the event trigger therefore not hindering pacing plus allowing players that opportunity that they now feel safe to save and exit the game because unironically the part of the game that I'm talking about the player's character is extremely exhausted which was how I felt after the three set pieces in the row.\\n\\nThe major one is using the controller. Since I have played the game mostly on the M&K I had no idea about how controller was like in the game until I had it plugged in the other night and decided to use it. There is a feature in the game the slows down time kinda like in katana zero (I had no idea this was even a feature) that allows the player to aim the grappling hook to where he wants to go. Now I didn't even once use it when I was M&K let alone I had even forgotten it was thing until I picked up the controller. Why is the ability triggered when ever you aim the grappling hook with the joystick? it should be a separate designated button, as it ruins all pacing in the game and makes it incredibly sluggish and frustrating as I was so use to just moving around super fast and making quick second decisions. I quickly unplugged my controller after that and continued to have fun on the M&K but please devs make it a separate button like in katana zero. allow controller users to decide if they are going to use the slow down ability or not than just forcing it on them.\", 'Fun game with great platforming. Story and art are great as well. Well worth the price.', \"Came across this game, saw the art and saw the Steam reviews saying this was like Katana Zero (a personal favorite).\\n\\nI do see why people make the comparison to Katana Zero but I wouldn't make it personally. It has a a lot more platforming, and the grappling is quite different (and good fun). Even the combat is quite different, although again fun.\\n\\nWhile the platforming and combat is fun, it didn't blow me away on its own. What did blow me away was the total package for an indie studio (from what I can tell) making their first game. The length, pacing, music, and presentation are all superb, and more than worth the $12 I paid.\\n\\nThe pixel art is gorgeous, and the framing of so many scenes highlights the art even more. The music doesn't quite hit the heights of Katana Zero or Hotline Miami, but you get the pounding synth tracks for combat and then the slower and more quiet subtle tracks for the emotional moments. Really good stuff overall, and used in all the right places.\\n\\nThe game is also well paced, no single combat/platforming section or story section felt too long, keeping everything moving. Each area in the game introduces new mechanics specific to that area that also keeps you engaged and having to learn new things. No area feels too long or drawn out. By the end you are zipping along and it does feel good. Without spoiling anything, the last chapter in the game pays off the progression in game mechanics throughout the game beautifully.  The game is just the right length I felt too to let the story properly play out and unfold without dragging or any extra fat.\\n\\nGetting to the story- a lot of praise in the Steam reviews, and it is good. You get enough to put most of the puzzle together before the end, so you'll have some idea where it's going, but the way it unfolds is compelling, and you won't be able to figure eveything out before the end. The story really pays off emotionally with a touching ending too.\\n\\nWriting and text delivery deserves kudos too, a lá Katana Zero, so much tone, flow, and personality is exuded in the way text bubbles are presented, the way they overlap, sound, changes to the font, etc. The delivery really helps get you invested in the characters, specifically the main two, but also the side characters. Even characters who get little screen time I found myself caring about. The writing and characters really elevate an already solid plot.\\n\\nTo put a bow on it- all of these elements make for a game that's hard not to come away satisfied with. It just hits so many high notes on the presentation with the art, sound, story delivery, everything. The gameplay isn't super complex, but it is fast and fun, and it stays fresh, introducing new areas and mechanics at just the right pace.\\n\\nSpend $12, play this game. \\n\\nIf you have a Steam Deck, great way to play.\", \"Sanabi is an excellent game that fans of 2D platformers/action games like Katana Zero and Celeste are virtually guaranteed to like. Bonus points for people who can't get enough of the Cyberpunk aesthetic or games with grappling hooks.\\n\\nPros:\\n-Excellent art and music\\n-Compelling story full of twists and tearjerkers\\n-Gameplay is focused, unique, and exciting\\n-No real bugs or jank to speak of\\n\\nCons:\\n-Some sections seem to stretch on for just a tad too long\\n-Minor translation issues\\n-Story feels a little contrived (very forgivable given the overall result)\\n-Death often spawns you back multiple rooms/sections, doing nothing but wasting your time\\n-The game could stand to be a tad harder (with more forgiving spawns, of course)\\n\\n\", 'fills the katana-zero shaped hole in my heart', 'Absolutely amazing game. I really love the story, the soundtrack, the gameplay, the story, the graphics, the characters... the story... basically everything. Would recommend this game to absolutely anyone, even if you are just starting to try out platformers or have never played one before. As soon as I started playing SANABI, I instantly fell in love with it. I used to like the old Spiderman games for the DS Lite, and I suppose this is a little bit like those games, seeing as it is a platformer largely based about swinging around. The Spiderman games sort of started my love of platformers, but then I started playing some other games like Minecraft and Terraria, but when I started playing this game I instantly started to love the entire genre again. 100/10', 'legendary pixel art painting of elon musk', \"This game didn't have the right to make me so emotional. I won't spoil it for you, but definitely is a game I highly recommend to any type of player.\\n\\nGame-play wise is an amazing experience where you feel like some sort of Spider-Man swinging around the city, and the pixel style makes it even more nostalgic like the old times playing a Nintendo a home.\\n\\nIf you want to ride a roller-coaster of emotions through the entire experience, I cannot recommend this game enough as it is. \\n\\nHope to see a Part 2 at some point, the story can continues its legacy.\", 'The game is a bit on the lower end of what I excepted on every level, except the art. The pixel art is gorgeous and tastefull. Otherwise story, gameplay and replayability were on the lower end of what I was expecting. The story felt short for me, it felt lengthy, corny and pushed. The gameplay, while still kind of functionning is imho on the low end of what you can expect from an action platformer, it\\'s too \"free\" to be smb alike, and at the same time there is no exploration nor freedom.\\n\\nDifficulty wise, it felt very easy, I\\'m close to 40 and playing non competitive games atm(work, day life) and I steamrolled it in normal dificulty while chatting or watching udemy course in accelerate on the side screen lal.\\n\\nIt\\'s still a thumbs up because I recognize the hard work and production value, however I felt that it was really not that good overall.', 'Fun Game.\\n\\nStory can be a bit dialogue heavy at times and occasional pacing issues, but its a real fun and beautiful game.\\nSomething I wish I knew prior to starting though is there is a setting for aim assist of varying degrees in the settings, the default is fine but if ya wanna feel like ya have more control disabling it is always an option. Would recommend just moving it around and testing to see what works best for ya.\\n\\nAlotta peeps compare this to katana zero, but it is very different imo. Though there is a healthy dose of killing bad peeps, unlike katana zero there is greater focus on platforming and the type of movement tricks ya can use with ya grappling arm. Combat depth when it comes to killing stuff like mooks is lesser than that of katana zero, but the freedom in movement with ya grappling around is far greater.  \\n\\nAnywayz, had a good time. Would recommend and all that jazz.\\n\\n\\n', 'Art. Kino, even. Would recommend.', 'I wish Steam would allow you to pick both \"Yes\" and \"No\" for the \"Do you recommend this game?\" option; that concept fits SANABI perfectly.\\n\\nI want to recommend this game because the pixel art, animation, and music are honestly breathtaking. OTOH, I [b]don\\'t[/b] want to recommend it because of the incomprehensible story (the spelling/grammar errors in the English translation certainly don\\'t do it any favors), the interminable cutscenes, and that the game seems determined to do everything in its power to get in the way of you enjoying it.\\n\\nHere\\'s the thing - the swinging is pretty fun! It feels good, the \"swing dash\" is honestly a really cool mechanic, and chaining together moves is really satisfying. But in the normal flow of gameplay, you get few opportunities to actually [b]DO[/b] any move chaining, thanks to all the barriers, walls you can\\'t latch on to, enemies shooting at you from a screen and a half away, etc. etc. ([i]Gravity Circuit[/i] this ain\\'t.) And I can not go any farther into this review without mentioning SANABI\\'s cardinal sin - the terrible, horrible, no good, very bad combination of overly bouncy knockback and a criminally short post-hit invincibility window.\\n\\nIf you ever hit the bottom edge of one of the red \"touch here and you get shot by an offscreen laser\" areas, you get bounced upward and thrown further into the red area, where you quickly get shot again, bounce up again, get shot again, rinse and repeat until you\\'re dead. And after you die, you\\'re treated to an instant halt of the music and a completely black screen for 5-10 seconds until it eventually gets around to restarting you at the last checkpoint. ([i]Celeste[/i] this ain\\'t). The same sort of pause happens every time you fall into one of the game\\'s numerous pits as well (including when you slide into one by accident, because there\\'s no real way to tell if the bottom of the screen is a pit or the way you have to go to the next section of the level).\\n\\nThankfully, there is a way to mitigate these issues somewhat - do yourself a favor and set the difficulty to Easy. When you don\\'t take any damage, there\\'s actually a chance for there to be some flow to the proceedings and it makes the game much more enjoyable as a result. I did that for Chapter 5 - after nearly rage-uninstalling due to the Chapter 4 boss, where falling in the pit at the bottom of the area resets [i]the entire fight[/i] - and the experience was much improved.\\n\\nI look forward to the next game from Wonder Potion - if they figure out how to make gameplay worthy of their art and music, it\\'ll truly be something special.', 'This game, is in the purest sense, ART.

So many good games released this year but what I was not expecting one bit was a game I have never heard that I impulsively bought late at night of to blow me away. From the first two hours of the game, I was hooked. I wanted to know where the story was going but I also just wanted to play more of its unique and fun fast-paced combat. Neither disappointed me as I continued through the rest of game as the story started to build on itself and the movement became more and more fluid. This game is by far my GOTY 2023 and is easily one of my favorite games of all time.', 'This game threw me for a loop. Fast paced movement + combat that you have full control over--especially when you learn to reverse-grapple. Maintained that flow through the majority of the game. The gameplay, admittedly, slightly fell off after chapter 2, but it made up for that with the surprisingly good story and homestretch. Wish it was longer though; there are certainly some parts I imagine could have been fleshed out more, but overall, I enjoyed the game.

Obvious comparisons to Katana Zero aside, this is an absolute gem in its own right. I do think that some sections of the game do drag on too long, but the game has such strong story hooks that you feel the need to get through even the weakest parts of the game.
