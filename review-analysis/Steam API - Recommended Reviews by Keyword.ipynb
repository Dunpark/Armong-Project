       "  'Review Content': \"Framing is an oft-overlooked element of game design. Sure, you can slap bullet time or save points into your game without explanation, but making them part of the narrative can provide unparalleled immersion for even the most outlandish titles. That’s what makes games like Katana ZERO such rare joys, the fact that every single element of the presentation is tied to the narrative and mechanics. From your time-bending powers all the way to the VCR you select stages on, this intense, bloody journey builds layers of meaning and intrigue around a single, compelling core: getting through this neo-noir hell with as much style as possible.\\n\\nIn the rain-slicked streets of a grim neon city you arrive, clad in but a bathrobe and armed with only cold Japanese steel. The voice on the other end of your phone wants you to kill everyone in the strange factory you find yourself at, a simple task once you start slowing down time to the point where you can deflect bullets with a sword. Room by room you expunge all life almost effortlessly, painting the walls with blood from an impossibly quick blade. When your task is done you return to your hovel of an apartment, your nightmares, your appointment with that voice on the phone, your neighbors, your demons, your rivals, your doubts, your fears, and the truth.\\n\\nTo say anything more would be to spoil one of the most intense and twisting narratives you’re ever going to get from a platformer, one that I’m going to be mulling over for days if not weeks. Your hobo samurai has a lot of people interested in his mysterious combat prowess, while at the same time you get to play through vignettes of his life as an attempted citizen. There’s often more drama in these little glimpses of city life than in the machinations of war and government he’s caught in, thanks to some excellent writing and world-building. Just the way factions from the war are mentioned, or districts of the city, or famous figures is enough to make the setting pop in a way that few games can.\\n\\nMore than this, though, is how the brilliant dialog system puts you right in the center of the story. It’s one of those where your responses are on a timer, and you must make your dialog choice before time runs out. However, most choices also give you a tiny window at the start where you can interrupt the person speaking. Interruptions can lead to wildly different paths through the dialog, and sometimes affect gameplay beyond that. And it’s all done in lavishly colored animated text that floats over the speakers, highlighting key terms for emphasis and shattering on interruptions. Just when you think you’ve seen everything Katana ZERO does with this mechanic, I assure you it will find a way to surprise you.\\n\\nThat’s really the beauty of this one across all its features, that it will never stop surprising you. Every mechanic and detail will eventually get used in a way you didn’t see coming, and that happens most frequently in the action itself. As a godlike samurai assassin, you have only your sword and your reflexes to dispatch goons, swordsmen, armed security, and worse. But you can slow down time to perfect your moves, roll past deadly attacks, reflect bullets with your blade, and sling objects like bottles and vases to neutralize distant threats. Each room must be perfected before you can move on, like little bite-sized Hotline Miami levels strung together in a mounting crescendo of murder.\\n\\nBut here again, Katana ZERO excels in the details. The action you are partaking in, the ritual of attempting, dying, and attempting again, is framed as the planning that your bathrobed terror does before actually executing. Once you have perfected your plan, the game replays the room for you as if on a security tape so you can witness your exploits at human speed. This is a key framing mechanic, and one that the plot centers on in a big way. And even this will defy your expectations in incredible ways, ways that make the game all the more engrossing as you battle your way through it.\\n\\nI cannot stress enough how polished every aspect of this title is, either. The pixel art is absolutely lush in its animations and special effects, making you feel ever strike of the blade and hitch of the video tape playback. The sound design matches the intensity of the action, and the soundtrack is some absolutely killer synthwave and soulful tracks that carry the neo-noir stylings to new heights. There are moments of levity, like the cosplay dialog options and Strong Terry, and moments of intense dread. There are beautiful vistas, and rooms caked in gore. It’s an incredible ride from start to finish, and I assure you that you’ll be left wanting more at the end of your 4-hour (or so) journey. Katana ZERO has a vision and it stops at nothing to express it, blending style, substance, and action into one of the most cohesive packages I’ve ever seen.\\n\\n\\n\\nDid you enjoy this review?

       "  'Review Content': \"I'm on a quest to find out whether this game is better than sex.\\n\\nEDIT: Had sex, the game is better.\\n\\nEDIT 2: So here's the actual review. I won't focus on reviewing just the game, but rather focus on the area that does not get talked about enough, which is speedrunning the game (the reason why I have half a thousand hours in the game). The game is exceptionally good at speedrunning, it's both easy to pick up and extremely satisfying to continue striving for even better times. Why ? It's because the gameplay is both satisfying and hard, and it only gets more punishing as you incorporate even more challenging ways of completing each room. A few more reasons why it's great to speedrun:\\n- Barely any RNG present when speedrunning (besides the motorcycle section, but the dev promised that he will make this section RNG-less once the DLC comes out) and the RNG that is present only accounts for a few seconds of time variation, so that basically only matters at top level. As such the player's skill is the only thing that matters if you beat your personal best time or not.\\n- The run itself is mostly gameplay, there are no cutscenes that you have to sit through and waste your time (there are like 3 instances total of the player needing to wait ~10 seconds in the entirety of the run).\\n- Most rooms are challenging to speedrun, and each one have ways of improving time. There aren't many situations where once you learn the particular room it stops being challenging or it's impossible to shave off further time (exception being the final boss and autoscroller in doom, but a doom skip has been found for one of the autoscroller parts, so that's epic)\\n- The runs are short, at top level they only take 15 minutes to complete, this means that you do not have to focus for extended periods of time.\\n- The game is very easy to setup for speedrunning, you don't need to setup an external program to keep track of time, since there is an in-game timer.\\n- The dev actually listens to our requests and will change some stuff once the DLC comes out.\\n- The speedrunning scene is active, so pop into the speedrunning discord server and ask your questions.\\nSo if you're interested in speedrunning the game, check out the guides section of the game's speedrun.com page. If you have never speedran a game before, give it a try, this was my first game that I speedran and it's a blast, give yourself a challenge first of obtaining a gold medal (~30 min range speedrun), and if you found it to be fun, aim for a sub-20 min run next.\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': '[b]Katana ZERO[/b] is a highly immersive cyberpunk/neo-noir (I honestly don’t know the difference) cross between Ninja Gaiden and Hotline Miami. Albeit incomplete and short, this game oozes high quality production from start to finish; my only hope is that the continuation/future updates will manage to maintain this level of quality. I also want to mention that this genre of games usually doesn’t interest me, so this experience was a very pleasant surprise. \\nA big thank you to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/dworry]dworry[/url] for recommending this game! \\n\\n[u][b]Played with PlayStation 4 controller[/b][/u]\\n\\n[h1]✔️[u]Positive:[/u][/h1]\\n[b][+] Attention to detail in combination with creative and intelligent design choices makes Katana ZERO an incredibly immersive experience:[/b]\\n[olist]\\n[*][b]We need to talk about how extraordinary the dialogue is.[/b]\\nYes, the writing is good, but the way that dialogue was presented is what really blew me away. The developers used a myriad of animations to incorporate “voice acting” in the text boxes without the use of voices at all. By changing things such as the speed of text appearing, and animations and colour of certain words or phrases, you get a very strong indication of the tone of dialogue. \\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2163734569 \\nFurthermore, you are offered dynamic dialogue options that change during the countdown. You can choose to take your time to select your most appropriate answer, or quickly and rudely interrupt whoever is speaking (emphasized by the shattering of the text box). Naturally, your answers/actions have an impact on the direct conversation and the course of the story. Katana ZERO may not be the first to incorporate these designs but they managed to execute it masterfully. \\n\\n[*][b]Superb attention to detail.[/b] \\nThere are multiple examples of this but I will focus on the details that I found really added to the immersion:\\n\\n(a) Random entertaining NPC encounters that juxtapose the gore and other mature themes that run rampant throughout the game. [i]You can also pet a cat.[/i]\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2163733927\\n\\n(b) Mundane actions such as burning your kill contract or drinking your tea at the end of a mission have to be triggered by the player. It may seem silly but the simple act of interacting with a tea cup actually transmitted through the screen and helped me relax after the high-intensity segments. \\n\\n(c) At the start of the action sequences, Zero (main character) takes a moment to put on earphones and turn on his music cassette, which in turn cues the in-game music. As an added bonus, the music is [u]amazing[/u]. \\n[/olist]\\n\\n[b][+] Easy to learn, hard to master type gameplay with the right amount of difficulty.[/b]\\nIn short, you can move like a ninja and are equipped with the ability to slow down time, dodge roll, slash your sword and throw certain objects. The time-manipulation is certainly overpowered but is not indefinite (used up like stamina) and is counterbalanced by the fact that Zero has no health bar; every mistake is fatal and will cause you to reset the room. Each level requires a balance between good reflexes, wit, tactics and adaptability. Optional unlockable swords aside, you do not obtain any new abilities during the game but instead get better at managing your time-manipulation ability to deal with increasingly complex situations. While this is usually not my preferred type of game, the progressive difficulty made for a very enjoyable, yet challenging, experience. \\n\\n[h1]➖[u]Neutral:[/u][/h1]\\n[b][-] Compelling but incomplete story.[/b] \\nKatana ZERO does a great job at balancing high intensity encounters with appropriate down-time moments and still manages to organically merge in hints of the backstory. However, the story is currently incomplete and has left me with more questions than answers.\\n\\n[b][-] Given all the buzzing and fizzing effects, this game is indubitably the worst nightmare for people with photosensitive epilepsy.[/b] \\nIt’s clear that the developers are aware of this, since they included a warning directly upon launching the game and also the option to turn it off. Since I do not suffer from epilepsy, I chose to experience the game as intended by the developers but found that it was a little too buzz-y and fizz-y for my taste.\\n\\n[b][-] Each room has a countdown timer to encourage a high pace but there were very few instances where I felt pressured to finish the level.[/b] \\nPerhaps the developers were too generous with the time given? This may not be the case for hard mode but I don’t know from personal experience.\\n\\n[h1]❌[u]Negative:[/u][/h1]\\n[b][x] Short.[/b] \\nMy first blind playthrough took approximately ~3 hours, and then an additional ~2.5 hours to explore alternative paths and endings. Upon finishing the game, hard and speed run modes are made available but I am more interested in experiencing the rest of the story. As far as I know, the developers have promised more content, so (hopefully) there will be more to look forward to!\\n \\n[h1]🏅[u]Verdict:[/u][/h1]\\n[h1]★★★★☆ A fantastic start[/h1]\\nKatana ZERO is currently an incomplete experience but shows a lot of potential. Despite thoroughly enjoying the game in its current state, I am slightly hesitant to recommend it at this moment. However, at the same time, the game shows enough promise to justify my faith that the rest of the game will be just as good (or even better?). The satisfying gameplay and immersive story form an excellent base to what might be an exceptional gaming experience. Let’s hope for the best!\\n\\n[table]\\n[tr][th][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/26827738/]If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up and follow me on my [b]curator page[/b].[/url]\\n🇹🇭🇦🇳🇰 🇾🇴🇺 🇫🇴🇷 🇾🇴🇺🇷 🇸🇺🇵🇵🇴🇷🇹!\\n[/th][/tr]\\n[/table]'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"Where do I begin? This cult classic has slowly become my favourite game of all time. The side-scrolling slasher has been reinvented as an amalgamation of Hotline Miami and Classic Ninja Gaiden.  \\nTelling compelling narratives in video games is no easy feat. Taking a heavily story-focused approach to design typically either results in more of an interactive movie or, in trying to balance both, nails storytelling at the expense of a top-quality gameplay experience. Every now and then, though, a game manages to nail the formula in a way that never feels intrusive or unnecessary. Katana ZERO is one of those games.\\n\\nKatana ZERO is incredibly secretive with its premise, and for good reason. The player takes on the role of a young man who’s seemingly an assassin for hire. He takes assignments during the day and returns to his rundown apartment building in a less than desirable part of town at night. Every day he visits his psychiatrist to talk through his experiences and get a dose of a mysterious drug that allows him to manipulate time (something that has pivotal story and combat implications). The prologue is simple and gets you familiar with the combat system. It starts off as your formuala one hit kill which makes you want to play smart. It quite steadily evolves into more with the addition of the Chronos mechanic. Though it starts out fairly straightforward, the story takes several turns quickly. The writing here is sharp, and the narrative runs the gauntlet of emotions from thrilling to comforting to horrifying all in the game’s short five to seven-hour runtime. I dare not spoil even a bit of the deeper narrative here, but Katana ZERO’s unique dialogue system forces players to make quick decisions that directly impact how the game plays out, making it worth playing through multiple times in to try other routes. The story takes many incredible turns which will certainly confuse you (so try and pay close attention to all the dialogue.) There's very subtle but satisfying instances of foreshadowing to spot which only adds to this game's amazing replayability. With a recent update, speedrun and hard-mode have been added to compensate with the lack of content which offers a lot more to challenge yourself. \\n\\nQuite on the other end of the scale is the absolutely stellar sound design and 80s synth-pop soundtrack. The ringing sound in your ears every time you get a new dose of “medicine” never stops feeling unnerving, and even the measured use of silence is done to great effect. There’s a great mix of energetic and sombre tracks, and I came to grow rather fond of the quaint piano keys that played during the more mellow scenes. Also worth noting is that the names of songs and composers appear at the start of each mission shown on-screen as the samurai switches the track on his walkman.\\n\\nKatana ZERO is a concise, mysterious and rather sombre game. The way it tells its intimate story is engaging as some of the best thrillers out there, though whether or not the story itself lives up to the delivery is debatable. Nonetheless, this is an action game first and foremost, and to that end, it passes with flying colours. Expect to die and get frustrated a lot, but also look forward to a deep sense of satisfaction after banging your head against a particularly tough boss or enemy sequence. There’s a lot of fun to have here and, with the choices you make having a significant impact on how the narrative plays out, it pays to run through the game a second time and try other options.\\n\\nIf gameplay, audio, visuals, and story were ammo loaded into a gun, Katana ZERO is firing consecutively from each barrel. With every component supporting each other, the title feels very consistent and well rounded. Any flaws like difficulty or varying times of knockdown recovery can be overlooked in my opinion. \\n\\nMasterpiece, 10/10\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': '[h1] Katana Zero is a game about a former war veteran, who works now as an assignment killer, wearing katana and samurai outfit. The whole game is presented as a neo-noir full of neon decorations action platformer with a captivating story full of twists and turnabouts. [/h1]  \\n\\n[b] Pros: [/b]\\n\\n+ Satisfying gameplay with fast combat and lots of planning\\n+ A captivating story that is easy to follow\\n+ Protagonists\\' unique abilities \\n+ Perfect level design\\n+ Outstanding pixel art\\n+ Synthwave/retrowave soundtrack \\n\\n[b] Cons: [/b]\\n\\n- The game is exactly filled with redundant swearings and dirty talks\\n- The whole game is frustratingly short \\n\\nJust imagine that you found a game, which is a perfect mix of one your favorite genres in gaming, it\\'s filled with your type of music and its plot reminds you of all these mindblowing movies you were crazy about all the time. That\\'s exactly what happened to me while I was playing Katana Zero.\\n\\nKatana Zero combines everything that you need to have in a game, that would be called \"a true masterpiece\" when it\\' released. It\\'s like picking perfect ingredients to make a delicious meal. But what\\'s more important is that aftertaste that you feel after the meal. \\n\\nThat\\'s what Katana Zero manages to do in the best way.\\n\\n[h1] Story [/h1]\\n\\nThe story is probably the strongest part of the game and it\\'s something I don\\'t want to talk much about, simply because it\\'s so unique and mindblowing, that you have to experience it all for yourself without any spoilers. The whole story had been strongly influenced by the best representatives of the cyberpunk genre and I am pretty much sure, that every single player will see this story in their own way.\\n\\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\\n\\nThe whole game is represented as a typical \"one shot-one kill\" game. You play as a veteran of a war, dressed in a kimono, a samurai which name, the whole story, and identity remain as a secret until the end of the game. The game\\'s mechanics follow pretty much the same idea: you come to the therapist/psychologist, he asks you a few questions about your health, gives you a mysterious drug and sends you on the next mission. After your mission is done, you come back to your apartment, watch a vivid dream and then repeat. \\n\\nOne of the first game mechanics you meet in the game is the dialog options system. The player always a choice either interrupt interlocutor with a nervous response or listen to the end to have more answer options. Usually, this interruption thing leads to unpleasant consequences, while if you remain patient, you have a chance to retrieve some new information regarding the story and the game\\'s protagonist. \\n\\nWhen it comes to combat, the protagonist has the ability to plan his attacks and rewind time whenever he fails. Once you proceed with the story, the game explains everything regarding this ability and how it all works. Since it\\'s a one shot-one kill prepare to die a lot and plan as much as possible during your game. The difficulty\\'s curve of this game can be a little bit weird: you start the game and it looks pretty easy, then few levels later it becomes way more difficult, then it becomes easy again and then everything changes once again. \\n\\nIt’s important to mention that the whole combat thing is pretty fast, the player can dash, reflect enemies’ bullets, roll between the enemies, make jump walls to get to his destination point, etc. This fast-paced action always keeps you strained never giving a little chance to relax. Most of the enemies can be killed by a single hit, some of the enemies can deflect at least one hit, so they require two hits to be killed but the most annoying enemies are the ones with shields, because they force you to jump over them and outsmart them, which can be a difficult task sometimes. \\n\\nThe majority of side scrolled levels can be completed pretty quickly and easily without any attempts or retries. Every single level is divided into small stages and if the players get a bullet in his head, they have to start over from that particular stage, not the whole level. What I really enjoyed in Katana ZERO is that most of the levels can be completed in multiple ways and the player always has a choice. It can be very helpful and quite convenient if the player is stuck at a certain point and the best way is to try something else.\\n\\nAll my love goes to developers for making the game equally interesting in terms of gameplay and its story. The more you play, the more you get into the story and feel like you don’t want this game to end. They were able to find a perfect balance between the gameplay mechanics, level design, some unique levels that are different from the regular one, where you have to kill everyone and then just run away, pretty interesting and remarkable boss battles, etc. At some point, you understand that you feel a weird satisfaction dashing through enemies and quickly roaming around the levels to fulfill your contract.\\n\\nWhat I really didn’t appreciate about this game is an incredible amount of swearings and bad words all along. I never felt like it was something required for the whole game or the story itself, this game would be even better without it in my opinion, seriously it was way too much at some point. \\n\\n[h1] Graphics [/h1]\\n\\nKatana ZERO has pixel art graphics that may look pretty simple from the first glance, but once you play the game for some time, you will see that every single level, enemy and every other thing in the game is quite detailed despite its simplified style. Plus all these visual tricks with neon lights, VHS old tapes, and CCTV recording screens add some amazing charm to this game as well.\\n\\n[h1] Sound [/h1]\\n\\nAs being a huge fan of retrowave/synthwave music myself, I instantly fell in love with Katana ZERO soundtrack. The whole game is filled with Ludowic and Bill Kiley’s tracks which perfectly suit the atmosphere of the game. \\n\\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\\n\\nKatana ZERO is a great pick for someone who is in love with action fast-paced challenging games and once you are into it, you will enjoy the game to the very end. It can be a bit annoying from time to time with its frustrating levels and a ridiculous amount of enemies, but it doesn’t change the fact that you are dealing with a great and quality indie title.\\n\\n[h1] Enjoy!

       "  'Review Content': 'From the outset, Katana ZERO wears its inspirations on its sleeve. Its pulsating neon aesthetic, synth-heavy soundtrack, and hyper-violent gameplay are all familiar trappings of countless flashy titles populating the indie games space. Most are lackluster attempts to recreate the magic of 2012’s Hotline Miami, failing to build upon the groundwork laid by one of the most successful aesthetically similar titles. Katana ZERO’s dedication to presenting highly stylized and polished gameplay topped with a thought-provoking psychological storyline is what makes it a standout title of 2019.\\n\\n Katana ZERO is a neo-noir action adventure title that puts you in the robes of a mysterious samurai hitman. Tasked with eliminating targets residing within the confines of the dilapidated metropolis by a mysterious employer, the player searches for targets as well as answers to their equally mysterious past.\\n\\nKatana ZERO’s gameplay concept is fairly straightforward, however the level of mechanical polish and style makes it remarkable. Levels, such as prisons and underground science facilities, are broken down into various rooms. Each room is filled with patrolling enemies that must be eliminated before being allowed to proceed. Combat is instant death, which adds considerable weight upon every action taken. Careful planning is required before proceeding, which places even greater emphasis on a required gameplay mechanic: death. Death triggers the rewind feature which, upon dying, shows the player a replay of their last life. This feature allows for analysis of mistakes or an opportunity to study environments to discover alternate routes or strategies to employ. In a game where death comes in a split second, this tool is imperative to mastering the fundamentals of combat.\\n\\nWhile death is frequent, most encounters (boss battles aside) should only require a handful of lives before being able to surpass them. Combat is challenging due to its ever-evolving nature which forces the player to be dynamic in their problem-solving. Fortunately, the player is given the freedom to pursue creative solutions to combat, as they are never pigeonholed in a single solution. While brute forcing their way through fights is rarely viable, it always remains an option if your skills are up to the task.\\n\\nAs you are a samurai, a katana is the primary means of dispatching enemies, but you also momentarily have the handy ability to slow down time. This makes evading enemy attacks simpler and ideal for perfectly deflecting incoming projectiles back at their senders. The feeling of lethal speed of your character is both satisfying and gives combat a fluency that’s intoxicating. There are also single use projectiles such as bottles, knives, and Molotov cocktails scattered throughout environments that serve as deadly commodities best reserved for tricky combat situations. All of these abilities are essential in exploiting the weaknesses of more advanced enemies, such as shield-wielding cops or katana-parrying thugs.\\n\\nHad Katana ZERO merely been a fantastic stealth action game devoid of a meaningful story, it would still be an easy recommendation. So it also offering an expertly penned psychological neo-noir story not only elevates but compliments the entire experience. The player’s plight to uncover their traumatic past is one that begins simply enough yet quickly presents many more intriguing questions. Snippets of backstory are uncovered during therapy sessions or visits to your dilapidated apartment in-between missions. While at the time these snippets of information may be confusing, all the puzzle pieces fit into place by the end. It isn’t merely rediscovering the past, but interpreting the present. The narrative frequently challenges the player’s understanding of their realities, with the concept of an unreliable narrator being called into question in more ways than one.\\n\\nThe player does have some impact on how their story plays out through the dialogue tree. Frequently faced with dialogue options during conversation, selecting one of three options results in varying conversation paths, and will affect the outcome of some sequences.[spoiler]In one mission, a hotel receptionist questioned my samurai outfit. Instead of ignoring her, I opted to give a lengthy lie about cosplaying as an obscure anime character. At the time, this was a humorous interaction and nothing more. It wasn’t until I was leaving the hotel, covered in my recently slain target’s blood, that a police officer questioned my appearance. Just as I expected a fight to break out, the receptionist interjected explaining that I was a cosplayer and not a crazed killer. The officer bought this and allowed me to leave the lobby peacefully.[/spoiler] Moments like this make the dialogue option more than a simple extension of the narrative, as the player’s decisions can have a meaningful impact on their progression.\\n\\nThrough the entire experience, Katana ZERO exudes a familiar but pleasing aesthetic and noir tone. It’s a gritty, yet illuminated neon city filled with unsavory characters who are a reflection of the run-down metropolis. Its environments are simple in their construction, but the minor details that populate the world give it life. Whether it’s your character switching on their walkman, blasting synth heavy 80s techno before every mission, or removing his katana before sitting down, the developer’s dedication to bringing this world to life is fiercely apparent.\\n\\nMy only complaint is that there isn’t more of it. It only takes about four hours to complete, but I am already planning to return to it to discover alternate dialogue options and to bask in its terrific gameplay. It’s a game that, from the outside, skeptics could dismiss as “just another neon pixelated action game,” which the indie space certainly has an abundance of. But Katana ZERO’s almost unprecedented level of polish, lightning-fast gameplay, and thought-provoking story make it one of the year’s best indie games.'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"[h1]Hotline Miami, Gunpoint and some guy who really likes cyberpunk walk into a bar…[/h1]\\n\\nKatana Zero is a story-driven action platformer developed by Askiisoft. You play as a damaged war hero with a weak grasp on time and reality who performs assassinations for his therapist. It really does feel like a mix between Hotline Miami and Gunpoint: taking the fast pace, high stakes gameplay style from the former, and the level design from the latter. I was really surprised by how much story there is here, I was even more surprised by the fact that it’s actually the most compelling part of the game. \\n\\nNote: At the time of writing this, I have seen one possible ending for the game. I will continue to update my review as I continue to play, but it’s worth noting that this is a short game. I’ve read on the forums that it’s expected to take 4-5 hours to beat, which lines up with my own experience so far.\\n\\n[h1]Positives: [/h1]\\n[list][*]The art here is fantastic. I’m obviously a sucker for cyberpunk, but the pixel art here is really top-notch stuff. The animations are also great.\\n\\n[*]As I mentioned, this is a pretty story-heavy game. Absolutely not what I expected, but it works surprisingly well. The game is well written, and the story is really intriguing. Everything is confusing to begin with and information is revealed to you as you play through the game. \\n\\n[*]The gameplay is tight and can be incredibly fast paced. There have been time where I’ve just kind of flailed around and hoped for the best, but for the most part it remains pretty precise. You blow through levels slicing up enemies as you careen towards an assassination target. You can also slow time and throw projectiles at enemies. Apart from some boss fights, everything here goes down with one hit. \\n\\n[*]Every time you die, you get rewound to the start of the section you’re in. The game feels fair, so whenever I died, I was only frustrated with myself, which is what you really need from a game like this. Figuring out the right way to approach things, or just improve your skills, and then beating a section you found hard is very satisfying. \\n\\n[*]The levels are really well designed, and there’s definitely a noticeable increase in difficulty as you play through. There’s not a huge amount of enemy variation here, so the challenge comes from where enemies are positioned in levels, and what other kind of obstacles there are. It works well.\\n\\n[*]There’s an in-universe explanation for why you’re able to ‘die’ and retry the levels. It’s not super convincing, but I appreciated this detail, nonetheless.\\n\\n[*]The music is fantastic. [/list]\\n\\n[h1]Neutral: [/h1]\\n[list][*]There are a bunch of secret achievements here, the majority of which seem to be related to things that are easily missed while playing. If you’re an achievement hunter, there’s probably some enjoyment to be had in replaying levels to search for things, but if you’re not then I don’t think Katana Zero offers much replay value. [/list]\\n\\n[h1]Negative: [/h1]\\n[list][*]Katana Zero’s biggest problem is that the gameplay doesn’t evolve, at all. You have a sword, you can grab things to throw, and you can slow time [spoiler](later in the game, you do play as a character who has an extra ability, but it’s still not enough)[/spoiler]. All of the game’s mechanics are given to you in the first mission and then that’s it. Like I’ve said, the gameplay is really good, but I was disappointed that nothing new was introduced across the different missions.\\n\\n[*]Enemy variety isn’t great. There are two melee enemies, two ranged enemies, and then one that is a kind of combination of the two. Now, these enemies are well designed and there’s definitely good variation between them, but five enemy types for the whole game didn’t really feel like enough to me. Combine this with the lack of any gameplay evolution, and the variety in the game really takes a hit. The level design is the only thing that keeps the game fresh.\\n\\n[*]As I mentioned up at the top, there are at least two endings for the game. There’s a crossroads kind of moment where you make a choice and you either end the game there or continue playing on. I am now continuing on, but I first chose the other option. I found that ending incredibly lacklustre and really disappointing. This moment in the game is made out to be a really big deal, and if you don’t choose to carry on then it kind of just ends and there’s no resolution to the story, and I felt like there should have been. [/list]\\n\\n[h1]Verdict:[/h1]\\n\\nKatana Zero has some major issues, but that hasn’t stopped me from thoroughly enjoying it. Tight gameplay and an engaging story, what’s not to like? If you’re a big fan of Hotline Miami-likes or games with similar level design to Gunpoint and Deadbolt, I’d recommend giving it a try. But it’s probably best to wait for a sale.\\n\\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider following my curator page: [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33633486/]Kemo's Corner.[/url]\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"[h1][b]Slashing Through the Shadows…[/b][/h1]\\n» [b]Katana Zero[/b] is a blisteringly fast indie slash-em-up with action that is an absolute adrenaline rush. Taking more than a few cues from [b]Hotline Miami[/b], it is largely about a drug-addicted neo-noir-inspired samurai who sticks a bunch of needles in his body. It wears its inspirations on the sleeves of its kimono but refines the tried and true one-hit-kill formula in a manner that makes it feels fresh, exciting, and innovative in surprising ways.\\n\\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\\n» This game puts you in control of a nameless samurai assassin with the power to manipulate time and see into the future. In an extremely clever and fun framing of the action, every level is contextualized as being the planning of an assassination. So, instead of your character dying, you are told “No… That won’t work,” as your precognition rewinds to the start (complete with old-timey VCR effect), giving you a chance to find a solution that does not end in your death. Every level ends with a security camera recording of what “actually” happened, which serves not only as a way to see your moment of triumph played back but also to subvert expectations in interesting ways later on.\\n\\nWorking up to that moment is a blast because Katana Zero’s action is fast-paced and empoweringly flexible. Like Hotline Miami, it is one shot, one kill for both you and any enemy that is not a boss. Your character can slash in eight directions, slow down time, use a dodge roll to avoid bullets or reflect bullets back with his sword. There is a great flow and feel to your character’s movement thanks to small touches like how each sword swing gives you a slight boost of momentum, or how you can cancel out of any roll, and the way each kill gives a satisfying screen-shake and pause to the action.\\n\\nHowever, the most iconic feature of this platformer is the slow-mo effect – specifically, how optional it is. It never feels too strong; it is on a pretty strict cooldown, and since enemies will hear whenever gunfire rings out, you will rarely have time to stay safe long enough for it to replenish. This puts it in a perfect spot as a powerful ability to get you through a tough situation while still being limited enough to keep the action quick.\\n\\n[h1]Story[/h1]\\n» The story of Katana Zero does not quite hit the high note that its action does, but it is at least carried by strong writing and a few great characters, such as your boss/therapist that guides you through your traumatic past while also providing you with the dossiers of people he wants dead, as well as a psychotic Russian adversary named V. It unfolds in a dystopian neo-noir setting, where you are entangled in a web of conspiracies and government experiments. Exploring deep themes of trauma, identity, and the consequences of one's actions, Katana Zero poses itself as a dark and mature tale, artfully woven into the fabric of the gameplay experience.\\n\\nFor instance, there is an innovative dialogue system that allows players to choose unique options based on their timing and interjections. By rudely shutting down conversations or patiently listening, players can unlock different dialogue paths, adding entertaining depth to the game. However, while these choices provide multiple playthrough opportunities, the story deviations feel superficial, and later dialogue options can be inconsistent with previous decisions. Additionally, the game’s narrative leaves much unresolved, hinting at a potential sequel or DLC, but the lack of payoff in this first chapter may leave players feeling unsatisfied.\\n\\nWhile Katana Zero will not take more than four to six hours to complete, it is a very tight four to six hours that cuts out any fluff. It never feels like it is running out of ideas, and every level does a great job of introducing small twists to its simple formula, from an underground minecart level to a motorcycle chase sequence on the city highway.\\n\\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\\n» It also helps that everything looks and sounds great. The slick neon aesthetic and fantastic sprite work go hand in hand with some legitimately impressive 2D lighting effects that give this game a unique visual style and personality. Accompanied by a fitting and catchy retro-electro soundtrack, the audio elements perfectly complement the intense action.\\n\\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\\n» All in all, Katana Zero’s time-bending samurai action is the star of the show here, but it's unique presentation and entertaining dialogue go a long way in supporting a plot that suffers from feeling like it is saving its best ideas for a sequel. As action games go, the game’s shorter length makes it a quick fix, and I’ll no doubt suffer withdrawal while I wait for the next hit.\\n\\n[h1][b]Score: 8.7/10[/b][/h1]\\n\\n[b][i]Was this review helpful?[/i][/b]\\n» If so, please leave a rating.

       "  'Review Content': \"I just played this and beat it in normal mode. I enjoyed the game very much and I'd love to see what happens next.\\n\\n[h1]Art[/h1]\\nPixel art that is well animated and engaging. Distopia future style. Extremely violent. Blood can be turned off. There plenty of the 80's Cyberpunk style.\\n\\n[h1]Story[/h1]\\nStory brings in a lot of questions and mystery to every single character. I'd say more but I feel this story needs to be experienced in the way it should be: Through dialogue text boxes. There is a timer on every piece of text and choices to be made within the time. Going through the story once, I can't tell you if choices change the outcome of things. It's engaging to choose a different response on multiple playthroughs.\\n\\nEdit: As I played a little more trying to get achievements, I learned that some answers give you different results in dialogue and give a little more depth to the conversation. Ultimately, your choices in dialogue doesn't change the main outcomes of game endings. Typically, games have a set ending no matter what you choose, simply because there is a narrative to follow or that making multiple endings is much harder to get done.\\n\\n[h1]Music[/h1]\\nTwo people created the music and they did an excellent job giving the thrill and motivation to keep going. Mostly retro synthwave with good dance beats.\\n\\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\\nThe controls seem a little, how should I say, fast but slow at the same time. It's tough to explain, but they are responsive. It's like each thing you do has a small cooldown period.\\n\\nSlash\\nJump\\nDodge Roll\\nSloMo\\nThrow Object\\n\\nYou are thrown into a 2D cross-section of stages with baddies to kill before you can move on. If you die, you have to do the entire room again. The game is super fast paced, even with the slomo gauge.\\nYou are able beat the game without slomo, but this is extremely tough, and should only be done in Speedrun Mode where the enemy spawns are not random. Yes, that's right. In Story Mode, enemies can spawn little off, turned around, moving in a different direction. This can be frustrating to those who want to get past a difficult section by learning a pattern. It can give a sort of fun challenge where it's not the same thing over and over. Things change up, so it doesn't get stale.\\nMy advice is to beat the sections purely based on light planning and reaction time.\\nYou can deflect bullets!\\n\\nAs you progress, new enemy types spring up, but interspersed with the old ones you have seen. Some have much faster reaction times than before. Careful with the muscle guys, their fist swing has a hitbox bigger than expected.\\n\\n[h1]Difficulty[/h1]\\nExpect to die many times. I'd say the game is not too tough, but not for the faint of heart. The game presents you with small sections where it doesn't feel like a unending gauntlet. You do need to think quickly and be on your toes.\\nDeaths are quick and can even be quicker when the rewind feature is turned off.\\nI did not get frustrated at this game's difficulty (Normal).\\n\\n[h1][b]I did not like being shot by enemies off screen.[/b][/h1]\\nBut you can kill people off screen too.\\n\\n\\n[h1]Stuff[/h1]\\nThe game starts you out with a small tutorial to teach you the basics of movement.\\n\\nThere are secrets, easter eggs, and other fun stuff to enjoy as you go through the story. The game is extremely interesting and wanting to have fun everywhere you go. The devs really put in a lot of thought into the games design. Take your time when there is down time.\\n\\n[h1]Small details[/h1]\\nStory Mode - has a slight randomness to enemy location, facing, movement with each respawn from death.\\nSpeedrun Mode - Unlocked after beating the game, with a bunch of nice settings for speedrunners, like removing the randomness if you don't die.\\nHard Mode - Unlocked after beating the game.\\n\\nController support for ALL major platforms - PS, Xbox, Switch, K&M, with icons and labels in their respective setup!\\nMy only tip would be to turn down the camera shake. I turned mine down to 5%. It was too much at max.\\n\\nI sort of wished there was no timer for dialogue, but at the same time the game urges you to just keep moving with your instincts.\\nIt was really fun to be able to NOT use SloMo and get past certain sections. Makes you feel super awesome not to need to slow things down.\\n\\nSpeaking of speed, take a look at the Hitpause option. This is an option where each hit done pauses the action for a fraction of second for dramatic effect. This also gives time for players to take a look around for bullets, but this can slow down and eat inputs. Turn this option down and the game will seem to go even faster and react quicker to your inputs.\\n\\nA lot of the changes in options makes it feel like you're playing a whole new game.\\n\\nI created a small guide on the extras that you hunt down. Just needs some sprucing up with images and gifs.\"},\n",

Check.[/b]\\n\\n[h1]Yes, that should work.[/h1]\\n\\nCurrently I feel ashamed of myself not playing this gem til early 2020. This is not your everyday pixel hack'n'slash adventure. Katana Zero is a phenomenal game. The way it presents itself is top-notch, the way it takes on dosing is creepily wonderful, and the way the characters develop is beyond your imagination. Plus, its pixel art is beautiful and that, is a big plus to me.\\n\\n[h1]Things I Like About Katana Zero:[/h1]\\n\\n[b]1. Combat System[/b]\\nYou are not any superhero type of guy. You only have one life, just like your enemies. Yet, your greatest advantage over them are the abilities to simulate the situation and to slow down the time. In the gameplay of Katana Zero, every combat in the level is a prediction in your head. The player has to perfectly clear the level in order to proceed. This feature makes every combat unique and a mini of its own. You may clear the level solely with your sword, or you can observe your surroundings and takes advantage of them. The ability to slow things down is your core element in the combat. If you have even a slightest hint of dying, slowing the time is your best bet. This allows you to see how the enemies will react and counter them immediately. These two ideas merge perfectly, and the execution is so satisfying that clearing a room makes you feel stylish and thrilling. Plus, you can deflect bullets back to the owner with a katana. How cool is that!?\\n\\n[b]2. Enticing BGM[/b]\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OylGrT6mK-M&list=PLWCkhGoFcFiw4wIjwIOEk6a3kE_KuHbp2&index=5&t=0s\\nEven when writing this review, I am indulging myself with [i]You Will Never Know[/i] by Bill Kiley. I must compliment the composers of this game. Those people surely know and do a great job of creating background music. In a game which hack'n'slash and good timing happen all the time, players might feel a bit tired of the gore and so many failed simulations. Here is the moment the music actually kicks in. The soundtracks are brisk and pleasant, quite the opposite comparing with the gameplay. This oddity somehow soothes the tediousness of mind, or even accelerates the efficiency of killing. I find myself think better and clearer under the light-hearted tempo the BGM offers, which often leads to faster level completion and a urge for more perfect execution. In another word, I kill faster and better with the music on, just like our protagonist. [strike]Am a psychopath?[/strike] \\n\\n[b]3. Intriguing Story[/b]\\nThe story of Katana Zero is bleak and beautiful. An ex-soldier, now assassin with a mixtape, who can simulate any possible situation in his mind and even slow time, goes on several assassinations and gradually uncover the great conspiracy behind the scene revolving around the drug he is relying on, Chronos. The farther he goes, the more shady and horrifying truth emerge from the surface. Even though the ending is a cliffhanger, the amount of characters development during the assassinations is enough to leave you breathless and you will crave for more. Not only the story is good, the way it present the story is good as well. Our protagonist is on Chronos, which often gives him hallucination and reality shifting. You never know which of which is real. Is the girl really there? Do the masked men really exist? Or is it all just the side effect of the dosing? This part of the story is open for debate, and I love to see community work out the possible whole story.\\n\\n[b]4.

       "  'Review Content': \"Katana ZERO has got it all. From the bumping music to the satisfying gameplay to the awesome graphics, and a great story.\\n\\nThe music in this game was fantastic. In most games, you listen to the music during your time playing the game, and then you're done with it. But this game's music is different. You will likely listen to it outside of the game (It's on Spotify!). It's really good!\\n\\nGameplay is also fantastic. Lots of slashing with your katana, or use environmental objects such as guns, flamethrowers, vases, etc... There's a lot to do with so few buttons. You dodge stuff, and slash stuff. There is minimal amount of puzzles in this one. It's quite challenging so learning the ins and outs of the combat will make this experience a lot easier. It's not too hard, but mistakes are heavily punished. And ah, dialogue is pretty great, but I'll cover that during the story paragraph.\\n\\nGraphics in this game are awesome. It's pixel art stuff, but good pixel art stuff. There are reflections, neon light effects, and much more. At no point during the game I was disappointed. I have nothing bad to say about the visuals of this game.\\n\\nAnd we reach an important part of this game. It's the story. It's good. The writing is done quite well, and sometimes on the funny side. You will likely feel multiple emotions while playing this game. It goes to places, and your choices impact how the characters react to what you decided to say. It's done really well, and well worth going through other dialogue options besides the main one.\\n\\nKatana ZERO surpassed my expectations, and has done a fantastic job at delivering the final product. I really enjoyed my time with it, and hope it sells enough for the sequel to the story. Unfortunately some complain about the length of the game, but I believe that this length is good enough. I patiently await for the sequel of this game, and hope that this short review gave you a brief rundown of the game enough to consider a purchase.\"},\n",

It’s a 2D platformer with a unique and interesting story that really grabbed my attention. I enjoyed the neo-city theme that was implemented and it fits with the pixel graphics perfectly. There is a lot to explain about this game, and I will be careful to completely avoid spoilers as [b]Katana Zero[/b] is story-focused.\\n\\n[h1]Pros and Cons[/h1]\\n[b]Pros[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*]An interesting dystopian story with many twists\\n[*]Multiple paths on how to progress through the story with dialogue options\\n[*]Combat is fluid, with having the ability to slow down time to deflect bullets\\n[*]Different ways to complete levels by either killing all the enemies or being stealthy\\n[*]Challenging gameplay where one fatal mistake can lead to death\\n[*]Nice pixel graphics that are very nice to look at\\n[*]Awesome soundtrack that fits with the missions\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Cons[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*][b]Katana Zero[/b] requires the player to have a quick reaction time at certain points in the game\\n[*]The keyboard and mouse controls are wonky\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h1]Story[/h1]\\nIn the neo-city of [b]New Mecca[/b], there is a mass-murdering katana-wielding assassin who wears a bathrobe named [b]Zero[/b]. This assassin takes kill contracts from his psychiatrist who supplies him with his daily dose of medicine. He lives in the [b]Third District[/b], a rough area of town with neighbors that are quite loud at night. When sleeping, Zero has nightmares of his past, which he discusses with his psychiatrist. That’s all I can really say about the story, there is much more to it but I want to avoid spoiling the story. \\n\\n[b]Katana Zero[/b] is a very story-heavy game, with that said it manages to bring a sense of mystery around itself after each mission. It’s like [b]Hotline Miami[/b], with all these questions that you will be asking yourself, like what’s the point in doing all of this killing? However, this is something you can change, you can choose to follow the orders given to you by the psychiatrist or not. This helps to bring some depth into the game.\\n\\nThere are also multiple dialog options that you can choose to unravel the story with. You can act nice to the people around you and play it cool or you can be aggressive to everyone around you, it’s an interesting way to interact with the environment. You can also choose to break the flow of the story in your own ways at certain points and it’s something very unique that I found very interesting, it messes with your head.\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2432225475\\n\\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\\n[b]Katana Zero[/b] has some challenging gameplay that you will have to muster your way through to progress. You can kill all the enemies in one hit, however, you can also die in one hit and if you do you will have to redo the level from the start. There are a few objects you can pick up like bottles or statues that you can use to throw at enemies to block a bullet or kill them. There is also a smoke grenade which is honestly my favorite one to use as some enemies will lose track of you to allow for some easy kills.\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2453437579\\n\\nSome missions will require you to be stealthy and this can add some more challenge to the mix on those levels. However, you can also choose to not do that and kill all the enemies on the level. This can add some different dialogue options from different characters and it can proceed the story in different ways.\\n\\nIf you feel up to the challenge, you can also go and play the game on hard mode. In this difficulty, stages will have new variants of existing enemies that will have new ways to attack. Enemies also have increased reaction time and some will shoot you much faster than before so be careful.\\n\\n[b]Zero[/b] has the ability to slow down time for at least a few seconds where he can deflect bullets or dodge certain attacks. This ability can be useful and will save you more times than you think. I should note that you can only use it for a certain amount of time before it needs to recharge. The main things that I found difficult to reflect in this mode were the shotguns and [b]Machine Gunners[/b].\\n\\n[b]Katana Zero's[/b] gameplay is very fast-paced and you will need some quick reaction time to dodge certain attacks. It will ask a lot from you so you will have to get used to what the game will throw at you in terms of difficulty. Another thing that I should mention is that the controls on the keyboard and mouse are a little weird, as the cursor is what direction [b]Zero[/b] will swing his sword at. So let’s say you have your mouse aimed upwards, [b]Zero[/b] will always do an up attack with his katana and this could lead to your death if you were not paying attention to where the cursor is located. I highly recommend using the controller as you don’t have to worry about messing up your slashes.\\n\\n[h1]Graphics and Performance[/h1]\\nI love the pixel art graphics that [b]Katana Zero[/b] has going for it with its neo-like city. Each area you visit is done beautifully and I wish I could look at some of the areas more often but the time limit prevents me from doing so. I tested the game on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, AMD Ryzen 5 1500X Quad-Core Processor 3.50, and 16 GB of RAM. There were no issues present while I was playing and this game should run on almost any computer with no problems. Also the soundtrack is really well done and I loved almost every song that was played.\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2453438798\\n\\n[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]\\nIf you enjoy 2D platformers that provide a challenging experience then I highly recommend [b]Katana Zero[/b]. It has similar things to that of [b]Hotline Miami[/b] in terms of graphics, soundtrack, gameplay, and story. The game is on the shorter side, maybe five or six hours total, so I do recommend purchasing when a sale is going on.\\n\\nThere is also a DLC that is being worked on and from what I hear it is going to be free which will add more to the story. If you plan on playing this game keep a lookout for this.\\n\\nYour mission is to join [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/5297658/] Life Needs a Little Sin [/url] for good quality reviews, burn this document as soon as you are done reading it.\"},\n",

The storytelling is captivating, but it went over my head until I paid closer attention, but maybe that's just because it's personally difficult for me to keep track of more than four characters at once, haha! Much more relevant to the point I'm trying to make, however, is the gameplay.\\nI absolutely sucked at my first playthrough, and I took only an hour less out of that five and a half hours on my second. And then I tried hardmode, which took seven hours and over 2500 deaths, and then again, which took only three and a half and 1500. However, right at the end of that second hardmode playthrough was exactly when the game clicked.\\nAll of a sudden, my idle frustration had turned into immense joy.

It is a fast, slick and technically demanding 2D action platformer that requires timing, precision and strategic thinking from the player. As shown in my total playtime, I clocked in roughly 14 hours at the time of this review. I completed the main story (which took about 4-5 hours) and hardmode (which took an additional 3-4 hours). The remaining time played was just me dabbling in speedrun mode.\\n\\nThe core gameplay is mostly centered around combat. This includes omnidirectional melee attacks, dodges via rolling, a bullet time mechanic, throwable weapons scattered around each level and various environmental hazards such as turrets and lasers. There are also different types of enemies each with their own of attacks, the gun wielding enemies being the hardest to cut down. That being said, Katana Zero subverted my expectations. I went into the game expecting a pure visceral combat experience but soon realized the game is much more than that. \\n\\nWhat makes Katana Zero so great is that it’s a game about learning. The player dies in one hit regardless of the source, whether it be from an enemy attack or an environmental hazard. Understandably this can be frustrating but at the same time it encourages us to think strategically about our next moves and learn from our previous mistakes.  How should I tackle this room? Which enemy should I hit first? What’s wrong with what I’ve been doing for the past 10 tries? This method might be quicker but it could be more risky? These are the questions I would ask myself while playing the game.\\n\\nThe combat system might look simple at the outset but it is quite nuanced and requires the player to make use of all mechanics in tandem to be an effective killing machine. Melee attacks can be used to deflect enemy bullets back towards them, which is an integral ability to learn in order to master the game. The melee attacks are also omnidirectional and provide the player with multiple ways to slash enemies from various positions. Multiple enemies can also be killed by a single attack if they all are within the attack’s range. Different throwable items carry with it different effects and might be more effective when used on specific enemies. The incentive behind using these mechanics in tandem lies with the delay between each melee attack. \\n\\nFor example let’s say you’ve got 4 enemies in a room. One enemy is a melee based enemy who parries you. The second one wields a pistol, the third an assault rifle and the fourth a shotgun. You can’t run into the room and simply slash everything to bits and pieces. You have tactically decide how to deal with each enemy using all the previously mentioned mechanics. Sure you could go in and first attack the melee enemy but chances are he’d parry you and that window of recovery might leave you open to being killed by the remaining enemies. Instead, why not dodge through the melee enemy’s attack, deflect the pistol wielding enemy’s projectile back towards him, kill the melee enemy from behind, throw the assault rifle enemy with a knife, dodge through the shotgun wielding enemy’s attack and finish him off last? All the while making use of bullet time here and there to ensure your victory? This is just a simple example of what to expect from the game and it can become much more complex during your playthrough.\\n\\nKatana Zero is a challenging but fair game. Throughout my experience, I never felt like the game was unnecessarily harsh and all my deaths were a result of my own mistakes. Enemies are hyper aggressive and will attempt to hunt you down once alerted to your presence so it is best to try and take out as many enemies as possible with the least amount of moves. The bullet time mechanic also helps make things easier but because it depletes much faster than it recharges, it’s not a get out of jail free card and is not an easily exploited mechanic. The addition of a countdown of each room also incentivizes the player to finish the room as fast as possible. Hard mode is far more challenging than the base game and mainly features more enemy placements, hazards etc .There are also a few enemies exclusive to this difficulty.\\n\\nThe story of Katana Zero was surprisingly more complex than I thought and was the main focus of the game. There are various NPCs that offer plenty of dialogue options and the story can get pretty dark. Right off the bat within the first 30 minutes of the game, a mystery revolving around the protagonist is already established and the story becomes more interesting the more we learn about his past. My major gripe with the game is the gameplay feels so good but feels like it takes a backseat to the story. The story is well written and I’m not suggesting they should have neglected it but a few more levels within each stage would have welcomed. Thankfully the developer patched in speedrun mode but this doesn’t really address the issue of a lack of levels. \\n\\nOverall Katana Zero is a great game. The gameplay is superb, the visuals gorgeous and the game boasts a stellar soundtrack. Don’t miss out on this. It’s the best indie game of the year so far for me and I recommend you buy it as soon as you can.'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': 'Alright, so here\\'s the thing. I played this game about a year ago. It took me two or three days to go through most of the content the game had to offer. And I still can\\'t stop thinking about it since then.\\n\\nKatana ZERO is a game that has essentially no flaws, at least in my opinion. We\\'ll play as Zero, dubbed \"the Dragon\" for his brutality, a man dressed as a samurai (much to the amusement of other characters) that seems to work as a hitman although not even he knows why or for who.  He just knows he has to carry out these hitman tasks, given to him through the psychiatrist that treats him, because Zero has lost most of his memories and doesn\\'t remember who he is, aside from a recurring nightmare that haunts him. What he does have, however, is the power of seeing the immediate future.\\n\\nUsing this power, he can infiltrate facilities and buildings without being seen, anticipating each of his enemies\\' movements and making a perfect plan to kill everything in sight. This way, the segments you play are actually Zero\\'s plan, and once you\\'ve managed to defeat all opponents in a level, you\\'ll see Zero redo exactly what you did (so a replay), carrying out the plan, but with no bullet-time (did I forget to mention that\\'s a thing too?). This is the way the game explains dying, which you will do, a lot. It\\'s a one hit death for everyone, both you and your enemies, so you will need some trial and error in each level to find out the best way to carry your task. This, if you ask me, is a genius way of explaining death in a video game.\\n\\nThese are the most interesting gameplay points, but definitely not the only good thing the game has to offer. The story is amazing and the way it\\'s told to you is organic and fluid, featuring some great twists, the graphics are beautiful pixel art and the animations are very carefully crafted, the characters are charismatic and well written, the dialogues are entertaining and often funny, the gameplay is super satisfying, everything is just perfect. The game also counts with enough replayability mechanics, which is nice because the game isn\\'t specially long. There are secrets to uncover, new weapons with different ranges and speeds, different paths to take and even a speedrun mode.\\n\\nThe single flaw this game has is that it\\'s not finished. The game doesn\\'t have an ending and the story cuts abruptly. However, it\\'s known that a DLC with more content is being worked on, so I\\'m not worried about that. I\\'m more than happy to wait for more of this masterpiece, one of my favourite games of all time for sure.\\n\\nBuy Katana ZERO. Please. You don\\'t know it yet, but you need it.'},\n",

They are all supposed to be free from what I heard of and they will expand more on the unfinished story. It's definitely worth buying this game tho. Alternatively you can wait for more to release but why would you do that?[/b]\\n------------------------------ [h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]\\nThe game is fast paced and really bloody. The game may sometimes be too fast and that's why there is an ability to slow down time. This allows you to easily deflect bullets or dodge past them.\\nYou don't carry any guns with you so the only long range attack you have is anything you can throw. From knives to bottles or even bust statues.\\nThere are some really underused mechanics like fighting behind a wall where you can only see silhouettes that was only used once as well as the other playable character that you also get the chance to play once. He is able to use dash that would cut all the enemies in front of him in a certain range but after he would be unable to use a sword for a few seconds.\\nWhat I really liked was the swords that you can unlock. They would offer at least some amount of replay ability by having a chance to play the levels in different ways. You can unlock them by finding collectible cards [b](1st can be found when you go left the first time you start to play)[/b]\\n------------------------------ [h1]GRAPHICS[/h1]\\nThe pixel art is so well done and it's nicely detailed which is impressive with the smooth gameplay combined. It is filled with awesome looking neon lighting and you can actually see the light on your character and on others and watch it move as you walk past the source of the light.\\nHowever, the first thing that really hits you, because of the look, is the menu itself. The levels are VHS tapes stacked on a shelf and you can also see the remote too which moves as you rewind or skip certain chapters.\\nAlso the speech bubbles are full of colorful text and they have a nice effect when you interrupt someone where the letters fall out and go off the screen.\\n------------------------------ [h1]SOUNDTRACK[/h1]\\nGreat soundtracks with [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIzZdsItsEY]*Hit the Floor*[/url] and [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj568DGRHGE]*V Limo (New Dong Shi--y)*[/url] being by far the best with [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v_RixPSnL0]*Third District*[/url] which also has some good qualities. Every level offers a unique song that plays as you slash your enemies. I really like how the character puts in his earbuds at the start of almost every level to listen to this awesome music. Tiny attention to details like this really puts this game high among others.\\n------------------------------ [h1]STORY[/h1]\\nThe story gets a little complicated and tangled as it goes but it's really not that hard to put it together. Just kill everyone that gets in your way, right? Well after a while it's not that easy as you start revealing all the lies you've been fed by and after that you slowly uncover your forgotten past.\\nApart from the main story there are nice little side stories like TV broadcasts, everytime you come back home from a mission, that talk about your doings or characters Strong Terry and Slender Richard (later named Skinny Ricky).\\nThe game also explains the reason you can keep dying but still continue to play. I love the game that can do that in such a great way.\\nYou can also choose multiple options that you can say. You can be rude or you can behave. These options can in some cases change some parts of the story that is unfortunately a little bit short.\\n\\n\\n[b]Prepare to take your medicine, kick in some hype music and play KATANA ZERO on a loop.\\n....\\nYes, that should work.[/b]\"},\n",

The core conceit of the game revolves around what amounts to two time altering abilities, a \"bullet time\" slowdown to help the player execute maneuvers with precision, and a \"rewind\" feature for helping iterate strategies for levels until the player gets it just right. While the gameplay is fast paced and high stakes, what makes this game great is not the mechanics alone, but rather how the narrative is perfectly served by those mechanics.\\n\\nTo quote Ron Burgandy: \"Great story. Compelling and rich.\"\\n\\nBut seriously, very few games achieve such a high quality blend of story and design, and while the game can be demanding in its difficulty at points, I believe that it is accessible to anyone with perseverance, rather than some minimum reaction time.\\n\\nThe game should only take you a handful of hours to complete (I spent 7 completing all of the achievements I wanted), which makes this fairly cost effective in the price-per-hour department, and there is an upcoming free narrative DLC that should add more to the story for those who are still somewhat worried about the value of the game.\\n\\n10/10, would drink the soup again.\\n\\nEDIT: Now that the Steam Awards are here, I am adding that I have nominated this game for Game of the Year, through a combination of intense game play, outstanding audio/visuals, and a truly great narrative.

Gameplay is fast paced and makes you feel like a badass, story is interesting and extremely well told with interesting dialogue with many unanswered questions with clues to leave players guessing.\\n\\nSo, gameplay. The gimmick here is that you can slow time (mentally, anyway), which allows you to pull off some moves that would be near impossible in most games. It's fun, fast paced and keeps you on your toes. It gets even more badass when you get to a point where you barely even use time slow anymore and can keep up with the rhythm of the enemies, knowing when they'll shoot before they even do.\\nIt pulls an undertale in acknowledging game mechanics like saving and loading as in game laws, although less obviously as this game uses precognition as the reason, which is an element I found to be very well done.\\n\\nThe story is told extremely well with a surprisingly fleshed out dialogue system, which is something games rarely think to do. It allows you to interrupt people as they're speaking which can really help you get emotionally involved in the situation or just to access funny flavour text. While I won't go too in depth with the story itself, I will say I thoroughly enjoyed it, sometimes even more than the gameplay, and watching the story gradually unfold was one of the most satisfying things.\\n\\nCall me casual, but the only problem I really had with the game was the difficulty that had me baring my teeth at times.

       "  'Review Content': \"Katana Zero looks like your usual 2D Sidescroller action game inspired by classics like Ninja Gaiden and Shinobi. But there is a twist to the game that is more reminiscent of Hotline Miami than those 8- and 16-bit classics. In this game, every hit is immediately deadly. This goes for your character and the enemies as well. So, naturally, you will die a lot. But you always restart at the same screen to learn from your mistakes and tackle the action in different ways. You could say that Katana Zero is partly a high-speed platformer-action and part puzzle game. The level design is great and open so that more than one path can lead to success. There are only a handful of frustrating passages.\\n\\nTight controls, an awesome pixel art look and some of the best synthwave soundtracks around also make this a very memorable experience. The game is quite story heavy so there is a lot of downtime between the sweaty action parts. The cutscenes and dialogue with some decision making are well-made, but unfortunately, there isn't a satisfying conclusion to all the mystery that is built up over the course of the ~5 hours campaign. Here is hope that the announced free DLC will answer those questions.\"},\n",

[spoiler]they added a new soundtrack and new sound effects to the V boss fight and it\\'s so funny. they added some funny details, like they changed the police car symbols to spirits and dragons, also they added 15\\'s soldier outfit for the tape which was nice. they turned slaughter house to meat facility and it\\'s so freaking funny, also in the bunker you see the body of bunch of nulls in the army suit that 0 and 15 wear, I personally think this will become some important part of the story in the future. I just finished the game, they changed the secret boss fight to a dragon and it\\'s so freaking cool, once again,[/spoiler] you guys who worked on this have my thanks.'},\n",

You also have bullet time/slow motion at your disposal to solve otherwise hard to beat enemy constellations and even deflecting their bullets with your sword.\\nI especially like, that you can also not use this and try to beat the level in real time. The bullet deflecting is also possible in real time but pretty hard.\\n\\nI watched a review before buying and the reviewer mostly focused on the graphics and gameplay (which are both amazing) and that alone was a reason for me to buy the game. But he didn't even comment on the story.\\n\\nThe story is very well written and the pacing of fast and gory levels and quieter story parts is on point too. This is also what differentiates the game from its clear inspirations like Hotline Miami. While I enjoyed this game too, the twists and turns of Katana Zero's story and changes in pace make it a much more  varied and rich experience.\\nThe music is a nice touch as well and fits the setting and mood, even though I wouldn't describe it as very memorable.\\n\\nA fantastic game, expanding on the one-hit kill mechanic of games like Hotline Miami, that brings a lot of its own new ideas to the table, never gets boring and gets you hooked on the story quickly. 10/10\"},\n",

Only a few of them I truly enjoyed that I put them in a special place in my heart. Katana ZERO joined that little group.\\n\\nSatisfying gameplay is the key of good games, this game has it. Even though it only takes around 3-4 hours to finish, you can feel the passion and effort they put into every level in the game. It's very polished and well-designed that could put those triple A games nowadays to shame.\\n\\nThose pixel graphics and the soundtrack are *kisses* top notch. The combination of neo-noir visual artstyle and the music really made the atmosphere feel more lively, moody and soothing at the same time. The apartment sequences are my favourite parts in the game. It makes you thinking about your life for a moment and how little things can be enjoyable things.\\n\\nThe dialogue sequence has a big part in the game. Your actions or dialogue choices can have you a different ending but not very significant. However, the story from narrative conversation is the main dish. The writings are well-written that keep you to play again, to see what happens next. Although there is no voice actor, you can still feel the vibe or tension in the dialogue sequences.\\n\\nThe best game in 2019 so far, at least for me.

It’s a fast and frenetic action game in which a single hit will kill you, set over a series levels that are subdivided into shorter set pieces and played to a great synth soundtrack.\\n\\nWhile it may at face value appear to be a sidescrolling platform game, combat is very much the focal point of the game’s mechanics with you replaying the current area until you complete it. Although your katana is your main means of dispatching your enemies you also have the ability to dodge, deflect bullets, throw environmental objects and slow down time. Although all of these abilities are available from the start, new types of enemies are gradually introduced as you progress that will put your usage of them to the test. \\n\\nThe various stages are woven together with a trippy story that blurs the line between reality and hallucination. These narrative segments help to balance the pace of the game and often intervene at unanticipated times which helps build a sense of intrigue and keeps you on your toes. The visuals do a good job of bringing the story to life and while not the best example of their kind are stylishly presented in pixelated 2d and are complemented by a fantastic soundtrack that kicks in when the action starts.\\n\\nAlthough the story is relatively modest in length there are a few secrets to find along the way including a secret final boss and you also get access to post game content including hard difficulty and a speed run mode after your first play through.\\n\\nAll in all Katana Zero is a very tidy, but challenging game that is well worth playing if it’s piqued your interest.\\n'},\n",

All the lore and mysterious character and world building of Hotline Miami in a cyberpunk, Eastern-inspired side-scrolling beat'em up. Katana ZERO's story is hauntingly beautiful, forcing the player to be truly introspective on what the devs are trying to say - a true story of trauma and mental illness that is likely very familiar to many people growing up in the world today. Where its contemporary My Friend Pedro was soulless and uninspired, Katana ZERO is an instant classic not only for the message it portrays but with the rest of the game's aesthetic as well. The anime-inspired character designs are distinct and impressive. The overall visual aesthetic of the game, and the game's graphics as a whole, are drop-dead gorgeous. I loved just idling in quiet areas of the game and picking out all of the impressive details that the devs left for us to see. The soundtrack is INCREDIBLE, comparable in energy and tact only to Hotline Miami's original soundtrack. So essentially you have a game with rock-solid gameplay, easily some of the most detailed pixelated cyberpunk graphics ever created, one of the most memorable OSTs to date, and a backstory/lore that would make RR Martin fans blush... you need to play this game.\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': 'Katana Zero is a game about murder. Which can actually be said about 99% of the games I review.\\n\\nYou play as Zero, a man who can’t remember his past. Zero works as an assassin for an organization in return for a “medicine” that helps him not feel bad. In return, Zero slices up people that...Deserve it? \\nI’m not sure. \\n\\nKatana Zero is a side scrolling game that focuses on fast pace action gameplay while also telling a rather intriguing story about lies, conspiracy, crime, and war. Its kind of proof that you don’t have to skimp out on one to get the other right. While the gameplay isn’t the most complex thing in the world, what it does it does really, really well. \\n\\nMuch like the weird kid in high school, you use a katana to ward off other human beings. Each level is played like Zero is planning out his attack, with the one you succeed in being the plan that works, after each stage, you get to see how it looked through a security camera, giving every stage this found-footage feel. \\n\\nZero can attack, dodge and jump as well as slow down time for a certain period. You mix these together with other abilities like throwing items, deflecting bullets with your sword, and setting up traps to take out multiple enemies at the same time. The game isn’t a cakewalk, but when you get going, you get going. Its fast paced and exciting to cut up a bunch of fools and not look like a clown while doing it. \\n\\nBetween missions, the story will play out with you choosing what Zero says. Sometimes, depending on what you say, certain story events will play out differently. There’s even a point where, if you’re feeling particularly glue-eating that day, you can lose your sword for the majority of the next mission. \\n\\nKatana Zero is also one of those pixelated 2D games, but it decided to play off that and dedicate to the artstyle instead of just using it as an excuse to make Atari graphics and call it the SNES. The Pixel art and backgrounds in Katana Zero are--\\nI don’t know, whats a funny way to say “really really good?” \\n\\nJuicy.\\n\\nKatana Zero’s pixel art is juicy. \\n\\nI’m not sorry. \\n\\nNew Mecca looks like a place I would actually like to visit, even though I know its a shit hole, or at least the District you’re in is. It punches all the right buttons on the “Things Dirk likes” soundboard. Beautiful twilight-lit skies, neon signs illuminating the night-time streets, long stretches of urban apartments, gives me that ~Aesthetic~ feel. \\n\\nThe soundtrack is also bopping, a nice mix of beats that keep the game going. It even has an in-universe reason to be there with Zero putting in earphones before a mission. I’m not really a music guy, so I can’t comment more on that.\\nGive me money and I can pretend to be a music guy, however. \\n\\nKatana Zero was a really fun time, I started it up and didn’t stop until I finished it six hours later. There are a bunch of achievements I missed, so I might go back to that sometime in the future. There’s more content on the way, or so I’ve been told.\\n\\nSpecial Thanks to Serc for sending me a free copy of this, he told me to review it and also called me a bad name, so I kind of had to or else he’d do it again and I’d cry. \\n\\nIts one of those indy games that actually tries, which is always admirable, especially so if the game is good. Go check it out, you’d probably like it. \\n\\nKatana Zero gets Sixteen Dirks going on Coldsteel to buy swords out of 10. \\n\\nPringles aren’t actually potato chips. \\n\\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/7124597/] Join the curator, or the nightmares will start again.

However, there seem to be several pathways one can take (as of now, i only got 3 of 19 achievements unlocked).\\nStill, i feel due to the presentation of the game, i already got my money worth.\\n\\nEdit 3: \\nFrom what i read in other discussions, and what i felt from my first playthrough, the game has no real ending, meaning that several questions remain unanswered. Which is kind of a bummer as the story was really good. Don\\'t misunderstand me it HAS the ultimate conclusion (the one ending i got till this point).\\n\\nEdit 4: \\nIf you choose not to die, you get more levels AND more lore. Who would have known. \\nStill, the end is rather open. Very open. Which is good as it seems there will be more of this gem. Maybe in a \"few month\". \\n\\nEdit 5: \\n\\nMy cosplay choice was picked up several times later during the game.

       "  'Review Content': \"Short & sweet, but replayability is key.\\n\\nGameplay in Katana ZERO is very enjoyable, with the core mechanics of a bullet-reflecting blade & slow-time resulting in a game that's as satisfying as it is stylish. That satisfaction allows KZ to last even longer than it should, as there's nothing to stop you from jumping into previously completed levels & trying things out perhaps you couldn't pull off when just starting out. If good mechanics alone aren't enough to get you replaying a 4-5 hour campaign, I'd still suggest it to be worth the money, but you might want to exercise a bit more caution.\\n\\nPresentation is also right up there, with the superbly executed Hotline Miami influenced ultra violent aesthetic driving a surprisingly interesting story. It's message response options often open the door to wildly differing conversational outcomes, which I enjoyed messing around with a bit given how enjoyable & funny the writing is, although even then, there were times where I just wished I could skip ahead & get to the combat again, as that's the real highlight of the title (alongside the OST).\\n\\nExtras? Speedrun mode, a hard mode, different weapons? Yup, they're all present & correct (after beating the game, of course)! The speedrun mode is very customizable, & where I personally find the value in the game to be. My only real complaint is there doesn't seem to be any sort of in-game leaderboard, so the only way to compare scores with your friends is the old fashioned way of just showing em a picture - Which is fine! But hey, a leaderboard would've been nice. Still, with features like level by level death/time tracking, the ability to skip any & all story content, use different weapons & so on, paired with its satisfying gameplay, make KZ a very appealing title for speedrunners of all levels.\\n\\nOverall, I enjoyed my time with Katana ZERO quite a lot, & wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone who feels they'd be able to find value in the post game extras/speedrunning aspect of it. If replaying/speedrunning isn't really your thing, I'd still very much recommend it, albeit with a lot less enthusiasm.\"},\n",

This often results in movements that you didn't meant to do, especially when attacking enemies that are above or below you.\\n\\nBut except for this minor flaw, the game is truly amazing.

You are given an interesting amount of movement options, weapons, and special abilities to fight, and enemies get progressively more difficult to deal with, or at least in more unique ways of combating. Movement itself can be a bit finicky, and while new features are introduced and explained well, the layout on keyboard can be a bit cramped when you need to pull off precise movements and inputs in a row. \"Aiming\" with your sword strikes in particular often cancels your movement unless you have both positioned perfectly, which is hard to do simultaneously when adapting to combat. The quick nature of respawning does ease this problem. The main game is just a few quick hours, but alternative objectives and new game plus modes most likely add replayability. A few mechanics and elements feel like untapped potential. The story is mysterious, thrilling, and shocking, and allows for some choice in dialogue and light branching story, although this would be better if more fleshed out with more routes and choices affecting the story or gameplay more. Music and presentation are excellent, a very flashy and colorful aesthetic. Certainly a blast to play through and discover. This is a very good foundation, but would be a must play with some polish, better features and customization options, and more campaign content. 7.8 out of 10 for the strong gameplay and killer story, but with a bigger scope than presented and elements that will hopefully be addressed in a sequel.'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"Indie games tend to lean heavily between gameplay and story.  Usually one is definitively the lead foot and the other is less of a focus for the developers.  Once in a while, a smaller developer brings a little more to the table, maybe making a more balanced game in those categories.  Katana Zero, however, is one of the first times I’ve seen so much effort placed in both creating compelling gameplay and a dense story coming out of an indie studio.\\n\\nAbbreviated Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37Dt2XHia1o\\n\\n[h1]The Familiar Territory[/h1]\\nDevolver Digital seems to enjoy publishing indie games that feature violent protagonists and instant or near instant kills.  Katana Zero takes after the recently release Ape Out and genre-defining classic Hotline: Miami by putting you in the role of a character with a penchant for violence and a katana that is exceptionally good at making your enemies dead.  However, in playing it, it reminded me significantly of another non-Devolver game – Door Kickers: Action Squad.  You see, in every mission, you’re usually assigned the role of heading into a building or facility and assassinating target.  This involves bursting through a number of doors and obliterating opponents as quickly as possible.  In practice, it feels so similar to that game (along with the synthwave aesthetic) that I would have assumed the same company developed them if I didn’t know any better.  However, the real meat of the gameplay involves a time-warping mechanic that is very distinct to Katana Zero.\\n\\nTwisting time takes a couple of forms within the game.  You already have the lightning fast ability to swing your sword and throw various objects around the map, but you can also slow down time to better execute some of the trickier maneuvers in the game.  For instance, you can deflect bullets back at their source with a well-timed sword slash, but achieving this without slowing down time can be tricky – even though if you actually do it, you feel like a badass.  Slowing time can also allow you to make better use of your (i-frames included) dodge roll that is often the deciding factor between life and death.   Yet death isn’t really that much of a problem for this protagonist. \\n\\n[h1]It’s Rewind Time[/h1]\\nPart of the 80s synthwave aesthetic is that you ‘rewind’ time, much like a VCR (tape lines included), to go back to the beginning of the room and try it all again.  This essentially makes it impossible to lose, but you can still fail as many times as you can tolerate it.  There will be points where it feels like Super Meat Boy in how many times you suck and have to restart, and just like that classic game, you’ll start hating portions of the game where you just can’t seem to get the timing down.  These moments actually play into the game and become part of the story in a way that I don’t want to spoil, but made encountering a fail state multiple times feel like there was always a chance to trigger something cool.  It made a great connection between the key gameplay mechanic and the story itself.\\n\\n[h1]The Story Itself[/h1]\\nKatana Zero is a short game, so the story picks up quickly - meaning there aren’t many things I can talk about without spoiling it.  However, I can also say the story is so erratic and at times hard to follow that I don’t know if I outright tried to explain it, I’d be accurate enough to say it ruined anything.  Regardless, one of the main threads is that you are in the role of an ex-soldier who is a veteran of a war in the game lore who is working as an assassin.  In this work, you see a psychiatrist who seems to be in the role of helping you get past the literal nightmares and metaphorical demons of your past with a combination of dialogue-option filled discussion and injections of a mysterious drug.  Yet, he also hands you dossiers on the targets for each of your missions, making his role a little strange to say the least.  \\n\\nThe initial mystery of the story element is compounded through your interactions both during and after when you return to your apartment.  Characters can pop in without notice and seem to know you, but it you don’t know if it’s someone your character is or isn’t supposed to know.  Every character is written with a motive that you’re unsure whether it directly revolves around you or not.  As the story progresses and becomes more layered and complex, you start to see what some of those characters’ motives were and learn more about yourself as the protagonist.  What makes the story the most compelling, and what may be the most frustrating thing to some people, is that you’re often offered a lot of choices in the dialogue that may play out in your actions and you have no idea if it would lead to real change in the game.  It’s hard to say if selecting one choice over another would a different outcome, but it’s actually one of the things I ended up loving.  At one point, you can even select an option that gives you a game over screen, complete with credits, and you just have to go back and choose the alternative.  \\n\\n[h1]Perfectly Balanced, as all things should be[/h1]\\nHaving an indie game with good gameplay or a good story is great.  Having one with both is even better.  However, having a game with both supporting one another is just amazing.  Katana Zero is amazing.  Even in my moments of frustration when I had no idea what the hell I had to do to beat an area or a boss, I still felt like the goal was within reach.  The story had me looking for more, thinking back through everything I had done and every event that occurred trying to better understand what was going on.  I wanted more of both, and that is one of the shortcomings of the game.  I finished it in just under four hours and that included some time spent messing around looking for achievements.  While the $15 price isn’t overwhelming, some more frugal players may want to wait for some kind of sale if they expect more time for their money.  I have heard that DLC is on the horizon with support for speed runners and such, so that may be something to wait for as well if you’re on the fence.  Either way, this is a must-play game for whatever price you’re willing to pay. \\n\\n[quote] If you'd like to see more of my reviews, check out my curator page here: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28346672-Endyo-Gaming/ and https://bagogames.com/[/quote]\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': 'The concept of time has long provided fertile ground for philosophical debates. The way we perceive it and how drugs can alter it can turn those philosophical debates into trippy affairs, as well as horror stories. Katana Zero is a pretty good application of that. Set in a cyberpunk world, with neo-noir undertones. You are playing an elite assassin, not very imaginatively named Zero, with a peculiar relationship with time. Zero is caught in the typical web of evil conspiracies of ominousness. Represented by his handler, who happens to aptly be his psychotherapist, his source of missions and medicine, ostensibly for his mental well-being. Armed with a bathrobe and a katana, you guide Zero as he carves a (very) bloody path through everyone and everything in his way as he tries to take back control of his destiny.\\n\\nThe game touches some pretty heavy themes. War, psychopathy, PTSD to name a few. And of course the perception of time. As Zero\\'s powers and drug problems increase he becomes more and more unable to tell where reality ends and delusion begins. As time bends and shifts his foretold final fate may be about to kick in, or perhaps has already happened. Narratively the game is very strong. There may not be that much happening but what\\'s there feels very personal. This, along with the trippiness present, make it very compelling. It helps that the game is very heavily stylized, with the entire presentation working to strengthen the experience. The music that Zero plays in his Walkman throughout missions is an example. Very fitting for the genre and organically tied to the narrative. Even the game\\'s interface seems intent to mess with your mind. \\n\\nThe game\\'s core gameplay loop is effectively that of a 2D action-platformer. Each level consists of a series of areas filled with enemies. Zero needs to either dispatch or avoid them all. Armed with his katana, all kinds of throwable items and time powers. The action is high stakes. As powerful and deadly as Zero may be, he is just as fragile. An enemy as much as sneezing on him will send you back to the beginning of the current area. One hit and you need to start again. This is quite innovatively worked into the game\\'s narrative, via the aforementioned time powers. Zero can predict the future and select the timeline in which he succeeds to become reality. Trippy but conceptually effective. Unfortunately, that doesn\\'t mean you, the player, can do the same. As such the constant pursuit of the perfect run can make the game feel repetitive.\\n\\nThankfully, the potentially repetitive gameplay doesn\\'t detract significantly from the experience. Unfortunately, the finale does. Or rather the lack of one. Katana Zero is incomplete. The game ends with a \"to be continued\" note, which happens right when the plot is about to reach its climax. Nothing is sorted out, it\\'s one enormous cliffhanger. There was a promised free DLC that would continue the narrative, but that was years ago. Not sure if it\\'s still happening or if it makes sense to even take it into consideration anymore. As it stands the game ended so abruptly I was left in disbelief. Besides, the duration of the game is hardly satisfactory. It took me about four hours to finish it. About seven to see most of what it had to offer. This certainly doesn\\'t win the game any awards for copious amounts of content.\\n\\nSo do I recommend Katana Zero? Well, as a game it\\'s not particularly interesting. The gameplay is acceptable but hardly groundbreaking and potentially repetitive. As an experience though it becomes a much stronger sell. It\\'s evocative and powerful, the way the narrative is presented, the style, the concept, all of it is praiseworthy. The lack of an ending and the short duration may reduce the overall effectiveness of the experience, but not enough to make it lose its allure. As long as these concerns are factored in and deemed acceptable, then Katana Zero becomes an easy thumbs up.'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': '[h1] Katana ZERO is a gem. [/h1]\\n\\nKatana ZERO is an awesome game, with satisfying gameplay, nice OST and immersive story. Nothing is told to you directly about the backstory or the story itself, you yourself must talk and play your way through to understand the situation your character is in. Although a lot is left unexplained, I really love that I was left with a lot of theories related to the story and I hope that the free DLC the developers have promised will answer most of my questions and bring us more of this beautiful game. A lot of people complain that it\\'s short, but after taking my time to answer during a dialogue and choosing how I want to complete a mission I was given, it felt that more time has passed than it actually did and that is something that amazed me, it\\'s the quality of time, not the quantity. Be it short and good, rather than long and boring. \\n\\n[b] Pros: [/b]\\n\\n[b] 1. Well written dialogue. [/b]\\n\\nThe writing is very good and the way it\\'s presented in the game it\\'s something fantastic. The developers used a method to incorporate \"voice acting\" in the game by giving the text change of colour, different animations and types of speed, that indicate the tone of dialogue. You are offered various dialogue options to choose from during the countdown, be it rudely interrupting (resulting in the shatter of the text box) or taking your time to choose the most appropriate answer. Your dialogue options will have an impact on your conversation and also change aspects of the story. [spoiler] Choosing specific dialogue options and executing missions in a specific way will unlock a secret boss fight. [/spoiler]\\n\\n[b] 2. Easy to learn, but difficult to master gameplay. [/b]\\n\\nZero moves like a ninja, he can dodge roll, slash his sword, deflect enemy bullets, slow down time and pick up various items, later to be used if wanted. Slowing down time sounds overpowered but cannot be done over and over, the more you use it, the more the battery icon displayed on your HUD (top left) will drain. Zero has no health bar, meaning every mistake you make that will cause you to be fatally wounded will result in a restart of the room you\\'re in. Each room has a timer, meaning you must complete the room before the time runs out. Optionally, after unlocking 5 secret swords, you can choose to equip one sword at the time, each sword having it\\'s own ability. After finish the game once, you unlock speedrun, where you can play on hard more, or test your skills on normal difficulty. [spoiler] During one level you will be playing as a character named Fifteen aka The Dragon, that can also slash his sword, deflect bullets, dodge roll, but his ability to pick up items is replaced with an instant dash in a straight line that kills every enemy in it\\'s path. This ability has a cooldown, during it\\'s cooldown you cannot attack or use the slash dash ability again. [/spoiler]\\n\\n[b] 3. Very well made soundtracks. [/b]\\n\\nAn aspect where the game excelled. The soundtrack is amazing, making it fit perfectly the scenery or the situation you are in. It can be relaxing, mysterious or edgy. The composers made awesome tracks for this game and I love it.\\n\\nLet\\'s appreciate that the game itself has only 200+ MB and managed to fit so much in it.\\nI have nothing to complain about the game, in what I have written above I hope I proved that this game is worth playing at least once or as many times as you wish. I give it a solid [b] 10/10. [/b]'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"Katana Zero is a stylistic indie action game about a conspiracy involving supersoldiers, war crimes, and using cosplay as a cover while you assassinate someone. It features frenetic gameplay where the titular character slices and dices through waves of Greasers with just a sword. Death can happen with a single hit but players are allowed to rewind and retry as many times as their patience allows. After each segment, players watch a short replay in real time, making them appear quite skillful, but this disrupts the Mach 5 pace of the game. In my opinion, the replay should be at the end of each level.\\n\\nWhat might surprise players is the strength and quality of Katana Zero's narrative, as it uses unconventional storytelling and unreliable narration to tell a dark but believable story of PTSD set in a bleak, dystopian world. There are moments showcasing the shocking nature of humanity but it never borders on pretentiousness or over-indulgence. Accompanying the plot is an excellently produced soundtrack featuring brooding synths by Ludowic and catchy house-like pieces by Bill Kiley. \\n\\nIf I had a nickel for every time Devolver published a colorful, hyper-violent, one-hit death game about a protagonist threatened by Russians, I'd have two nickels.

Sure, many may point to the 4 hour play time (despite more content seemingly coming) and sit there going that the price tag may be too much. But that would be the case if the game wasn't as polished as Katana Zero is. I mean, it helps that the game has reasonably replayability with the story paths and the gameplay has a natural flow to it, where you get lost in the beautiful environments. There's something badass about seeing your replay in full speed, as you see how you were able to reflect the bullet right back in the head, or dodge roll at the right time to slash at an enemy. Rarely do I say the game is for everyone, but I feel that Katana Zero hits a wide arrange of wants/positives that everyone can enjoy elements of it. \\n\\nEnemy variety may be lacking for some, but it works for me here as it takes reasonably different tactics to deal with each, and the level design uses those enemies rather well in placing the samurai in new situations. I do appreciate that those who really get prediction timing down don't actually need the time slow mechanic most of the time, and I can see speed runs becoming popular with the game due to that element. Boss fights were simple but effective, and the game hung around long enough with gameplay variety to never feel boring, but not strained out. Sound design is on point, along with a set of music tracks that are appropriate to the  \\n\\nThe surprise of this package however is the story, which has multiple layers exploring themes of the savage nature of war, the use of drugs to cure one's self, and various other heart touching topics. There's a small series of characters that all have reasonable definition, including the little girl which you want to protect no matter what it takes. You connect with our main samurai, you want to take his persona as you interrupt the enemy's dialogue, and while you may not get the conclusion you want yet, it's a story that's worth following and not just a thrown in segment for a indie game. There's a ton of depth here, and one I'll be coming back to. \\n\\nHonestly, I'm sitting here wondering if I gave the game too low of a score after re-writing this after doing the video review. It's still a must buy no matter what. A great example of modern day video games.\\n\\n[b]Video Review: [/b]  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNKIIgJC_4c \\n\\n[u] Lists: [/u]\\n[b]Positives:[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Love that the slow down mechanic still takes skill: rapidly hitting the slash button will punish you: not many slow down mechanics do that.\\n[*] Enemy Design is simple and straight forward, but takes different tactics with shotgun enemies and shield swat members.\\n[*] Level Design uses the enemies well in placement, and despite there's repetition, it never FEELS the same. \\n[*] Crisp controls are perfect for the gameplay.\\n[*] Great speed running possibilities. \\n[*] Story has a lot of layers to it and has a lot of emotional depth. Fantastic.\\n[*] The samurai/little girl connection is touching and is surprising because those types of connections for me feel forced. Relatable dialogue and charm push Katana Zero past that trope.\\n[*] Replayability in the dialogue tree. \\n[*] Movement is crisp and feels excellent: punishing you for imprecision but not feeling like you're bashing your hands against the keyboard to get things to work.\\n[*] Sound Design does well to give you feedback, but doesn't over do it. \\n[*] Music OST is going to be one to listen to outside of the game. Great action music. \\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*]  Some people may say it's short at 4 hours. I think it's fine at its length (with more to come) but I can see why people wanted more.\\n[*] I feel like I have to wait for the “true” ending (I might have missed it though), but I'm really stretching for negatives here. \\n[*] There can be a frustration factor here in the middle third....I guess.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b] If you want more reviews/information regarding games I've reviewed, visit my curator.

       "  'Review Content': 'Katana Zero is a side scrolling hack and slash platformer where you need precision control to murder your way through each stage, as you try to uncover your past. It offers plenty of fun gameplay as you master your abilities, and a fairly free ability to make the story evolve as you want to along with a pumping soundtrack. I highly recommend playing it if you haven’t already, though an average run only last a few hours.\\n \\n[b]Story[/b]\\nYou play as an amnesic katana wielding assassin who can slow down time and uses precognitive abilities to plan your path through stages. I found the story great, and it had plenty of twists I didn’t expect and kept me guessing as to what was real and what the character was imagining until it all came together in the end, though there are a few lose plot points I wish the game explored further. It feels heavily influenced by the Vietnam War, and has equivalents of a lot of controversial topics. Between each mission you have therapy sessions with your shrink to help with your PSTD from the war you fought in, and nightmares after each completed mission. Depending on how targets were eliminated, dialogue options you pick and if you follow orders the story re-frames itself, which can keep you (the player) in the dark about what is happening, or completely change your perception of what’s happening. Are you a war vet having a mental breakdown, a pawn of a clandestine shadowy government operation, or something else? I didn’t see the ending coming, which totally puts a different slant on the entire game.\\n\\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\\nWow. I found this seriously fun to play. The gameplay is simple, but requires a good deal of precision as you dodge, slow down time, throw object and reflect bullets back at enemies as you work towards each target. Even being out slightly results in death, and results in a restart of the screen you are on, but thankfully each stage is small so you aren’t losing tons of time and effort with each death. Each of the stages is well designed, with a few different options for you to move around as you murder your way through to your target. Every enemy needs to be dealt with, you mission guidelines don’t allow you to leave anyone alive. After each mission you have the option of watching your run, which I thought was fairly cool.\\n\\nEnemies are copies of each other so you know their attack profiles, and while they might be generic they are deadly. All of them are crack shots if you are standing still or not using your abilities, and throw in some of the traps found in each stage or environmental hazards makes for interesting combat. You have a few different one time objects you can find scattered across each stage which can be thrown at enemies or used to help you progress. \\n\\nThe game isn’t afraid to change things up, some missions have you progressing while remaining unseen (like sneaking into a prison or nightclub), and encourage you to not kill anyone, while a later stages has you babysitting a mining kart while racing to hit the track mechanisms to keep it moving. There’s a stage where you are chasing down a boss and killing mobs while riding a motorbike down the highway, and a stage where you control someone else who has similar abilities to you but is more in control of them.\\n\\nBoss fights are interesting, with some of them skipping ahead if you fail enough, but most require the precision fighting techniques to pass, and become easier when you have the patterns figured out. The hidden boss fight was a great Akria reference!\\n\\nThe game has some replayabilitiy in the fact that you can load up missions and change your response to certain areas, which can change future outcomes. This can change what you experience in the nightmares and potentially opens up a secret boss, as well as achievements. There is also a hard mode and speed run mode for those who wish to test themselves. \\n\\n[b]Graphics[/b]\\nThe game is pixel based, but looks great with that aesthetic. As you kill enemies, the blood sprays over the walls and furniture, leaving you painting the stages with enemy’s blood. It’s easy to tell where you are and if enemies can see you or if they are alerted, though I ran into a few instances where the enemies were shooting at me from off screen. Depending on the character’s state of mind screen distortion or other effects can occur which messes with you, and feeds into the story. I didn’t experience any issues or bugs while playing the game, it feels highly polished.\\n\\n[b]Music[/b]\\nThe soundtrack is heavily synth based, with a large dose of drums. I found the soundtrack great to listen to, with their being plenty of variety and the mission music kind of energising you, while the music outside of stages feeling dark. Its available as a separate purchase if soundtracks are your thing.\\n\\n[b]Achievements[/b]\\nMost of the achievements are easy enough to get, however the speedrun and hard mode might cause issues for some.\\n\\nFor more reviews please visit https://store.steampowered.com/curator/31327216/'},\n",

Unfortunately I started it in the evening. It's 7AM and I just finished it, I'm a bit tired but I don't regret anything. \\nEverything you need to know is that you're a samurai and the game exists in your head, you won't make any move until you get things done without being harmed in your mind, then do exactly the same in his real world. You can only die in your mind and if you do you get sent back to a checkpoint. As long as you take your medicine you are immortal.\\nThe chat is something special that I haven't seen in any other game, heard about immortality talking in Undertale (Thanks Sans, very cool), but in tiny amounts. What it really is you will find by yourself if you decide to play this artistic game, it is something that's a crime to spoil.\\nThe soundtrack genres differ on what you are doing: Vaporwave and Synthwave for fighting, Jazz for relaxing at home and Hardbass for arguing with idiots while receiving russian swearing. I loved it.\\nAs I said up there, the game is very aesthetic. The pixel graphics look very nice, I prefer those over ultra realistic graphics. This is the best and one of the cheapest purchases i made for the past year. \\n\\nIf my eyes were still working I noticed that the game was made totally by one person (excluding the music and publishing).

You play as Zero and, without spoiling too much of this one-of-a-kind story, you spend the entire game choosing a path which will explain as much or as little of his backstory as you choose. KatanaZero does not stray away from the worst part of what makes people human instead it embraces it and uses it to magnify their narrative. This, combined with a perfect score by LudoWic and Bill Kiley, creates what I consider to be the perfect game as it plays like your classic side-scrolling platformer hack-n-slash but [b]feels[/b] like an investigation into man and it's greatest mistakes.\\n\\nI must warn people who are considering playing this game: it is very raw and graphic for a pixel game; you will feel very vulnerable and emotionally-defenceless but by embracing that moment of weakness you will experience this to it's absolute fullest. \\n\\nKatanaZero is a must-buy.

In the ever-growing battle between what is and is not art this is one of the greatest examples of live-art. \\n\\nRating: 10 / 10\\n\\nThank you Askiisoft.\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': 'It\\'s Neo-Noir alright.\\n\\nFor the most part, Katana ZERO is what it looks like. A fast-paced slasher-platformer with instant death and time manipulation. It\\'s easier than you\\'d expect (from Hotline Miami for example) but still non-trivial, and you can choose not to use time slowdown. But let\\'s be honest: gameplay is not the main draw here, at least it wasn\\'t for me.\\n\\nIt\\'s the story. More specifically, the way it\\'s told.\\n\\nThe game takes the concept of \"unreliable narrator\" and runs with it... but just carefully enough to make you actually wonder what\\'s real and what\\'s not. Classic Noir; and Katana ZERO iterates on this concept with creative usage of glitchcore. And when you throw in some serious mental health issues and drugs into the mix... well, the result is potent.\\n\\nThen, there\\'s the aesthetic. Some people think that pixel art is \"bad graphics\"; I won\\'t insult you by assuming you\\'re one of them. Instead I\\'ll point out that the sprites are detailed and expressive, and the animations are very smooth with lots and lots of frames. They\\'re also very varied - for example, there\\'s a mission that takes place in a club, and there\\'s an animation of the protagonist dancing - just for this one room. \\n\\nOn the topic of clubs; the music is very fitting. \"Dark synthwave\" would be my best attempt to categorise it? Slower, heavier Carpenter Brut? A little like Hotline Miami\\'s, but less flashy? I don\\'t know, I review games, not music.\\n\\nFinally, I have a complaint. The game\\'s story isn\\'t self-contained - it ends on a cliffhanger of sorts. Still, it\\'s a Noir story, so a certain lack of closure is fitting. Besides, the rest is so good I can forgive this little thing.\\n\\nWith all that said, I don\\'t think Katana ZERO is as good as the reviews make it look. It\\'s polished and has interesting narration, but something felt missing the entire time I was playing. Maybe I simply didn\\'t like the gameplay all that much. Maybe the plot was  too... \"snuff\" for me. Or maybe I found the general story a little too vague. But overall I had fun and the plot kept my attention, and I\\'d say the game\\'s definitely worth playing.\\n\\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42922988/]Curator Page[/url]'},\n",

Be wary if you haven't completed the game, and please do. --\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis genuinely has to be my one of- if not my favorite pieces of fiction ever.\\n\\nThis game is one of the best examples I can give to anybody that shows great writing, artstyle, representation, and musical talent.\\n\\nKatana Zero is not only a fun game, but an amazing game. With rapid, satisfying movements that feel deserved depending on the actions you do in gameplay, nothing feels entirely unfair or downright stupid. It eases the player into gradually harder difficulty while not doing it instantly or too slowly; it's just right.\\n\\nThe music is phenomenal, showcasing intense songs that compliment the fast-paced gameplay, but also calming down at important story points- or even getting more intense. Basically, the music goes along with what's happening currently very well. Plus I just love listening to it on my free time, if that says anything.\\n\\nThe story is something I genuinely adore. While as of now not everything is clear but eventually could be as the arrival of the DLC is still being awaited- it keeps you intrigued. Not only does it display great examples of withdrawal and what being on a drug does to you, but also expresses the mental state very well. We don't know much about our protagonist Zero, and even less about his companion Fifteen, but we for sure know that both of these individuals aren't ok. Zero's thoughts and having options in the game such as defying your therapist and killing innocents like a homeless man give a glimpse into his deterioration, and like said before withdrawal. One of these examples being the rooftop scene. We know Zero's done some horrible things in his life according to the church scene, and we know he regrets them via his words. But, he knows he's done at least one good thing in his life that can't hold him down. Zero's perception of time is fucked frankly, and he is severely mentally damaged, but he isn't heartless. He's a very caring character with his own motivations, and I love him.\\n\\n\\nAll in all, I do love this game. I replay it time and time again or even just a quick session to see some bodies drop, and always remember the importance of this game.\\n\\nI await the DLC and genuinely hope for it soon.\\n\\n\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"Katana Zero is a slick side scrolling 2d Action game that mixes gritty cyberpunk aesthetic with 80's neon, stirs in some Hotline Miami game stylings, and serves it up in a cool smoothie cup. It's one shot one kill, high reflex perfect execution all the way through, and tells a war-drama story behind mysterious machines, child soldiers, and drug running.\\n\\nThe game has detailed pixel art and an electronic soundtrack that keeps you focused on the action, and recognizing everything happening at a glance, while still making everything look stylish, and fitting the game's overall aesthetic. Your character moves with a steady flow, and does so responsively. The game's story is about a mysterious samurai who appears to act as the assassin for his therapist, who dispenses medicine, biting sarcasm, and new missions, in equal measure. The game quickly spirals out as you learn more about the world's politics, wars, and governmental black ops, including secret super-soldier projects. The game takes place over distinct levels with walking and dialogue sections, and then action sections, broken down into levels.\\n\\nThe meat of the game is these action sections, where your job is generally to kill every single person in an area, from club wielders, to pistoliers, machine gun users, and more. Every enemy type acts predictably, meaning you can lure enemies around, know what they'll do and how they'll react, and be in total control. On top of that, you have the ability to slow down time, reflect bullets, pick up and fling objects, and dive in and out of cover. At the end of your carnage, you're treated to an optional view of what happened from the POV of a security camera in normal time, which can be fun to watch if you made excessive use of the slow time power. Every enemy dies in a single hit, and so do you, so combat becomes a planned dance of katana slashes, diving under stairs, throwing trophies and fire extinguishers, and dodging and reflecting bullets, before standing alone in a sea of blood. Each mission has different twists to mix it up, and the game throws consistent new challenges and situations at you all the way to the end. It's not a long game, so it never wears out its welcome.\\n\\nThe game does dialogue interestingly, where you can interject and interrupt dialogue, or wait for it to play out, then make decisions. In practice, this doesn't generally affect gameplay - there's no real decision branches - but it does add a feel to the game where you can react to situations how you'd like, playing hard and aggressive, or more thoughtful, both in dialogue and gameplay. Though not affecting mechanics, it gives more immersion.\\n\\nOver the course of the game, there's also some secrets and unlockables, and when you beat the game, you can use them in future play modes, like different weapon types, various speedrunning, modes, and a secret, hidden boss near the end of the game that's the toughest thing around.\\n\\nStrong recommendation to anyone who loves action games, and especially if you crave the cyberpunk or Hotline Miami aesthetic.\"},\n",

The plot of this game is very slow-burning, however it still managed to captivate me and make me interested in the characters and the events of the game. I\\'m not going to talk much more of the story in this review as it\\'s best experienced blind in my opinion\\n\\nThe game itself is fairly short, only taking me around 5 or 6 hours to reach the ending.\\n\\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\\nThe gameplay is where this game is at it\\'s best. With a mix of classic Ninja Gaiden hacking and slashing, and the quick one-shot-one-kill gameplay of Hotline Miami, it\\'s a great blend of planning out your moves and executing them with perfect precision. Gladly however, the mechanic in this game that allows Zero to slow down time briefly on a cool-down, rectifies needing to be pixel perfect with more time to perform some of the harder combos of attacks. The differentiating enemies you fight throughout the game are great, and each one brings something new to the table and makes you have to think of a strategy to work around their strengths and weaknesses.\\n\\n[h1] Art [/h1]\\nKatana Zero has some really beautiful pixel art, with some simple and effective, yet very expressive character sprites. The animations are simply amazing, watching an enemy\\'s body keel over after i slash it really gives it more [i] oomph, [/i] and helps with visual response. All of these aspects fit well with the stunning backdrops and help make New Mecca feel alive.\\n\\n[h1] Music [/h1] \\nI\\'d confidently say that buying this game is worth it for the OST alone. With a retro-electro soundtrack similar to other Devolver games like My Friend Pedro and the Hotline Miami series, it\\'s very good at setting the tone for the levels, and suits the fast-paced hacking and slashing. I really can\\'t find a track in this OST I don\\'t like.\\n\\nTL;DR:\\n[b] Personal Pros [/b]\\n- Captivating setting and plot, great characters \\n- Gameplay that is a frenzy of blood, bullets and breakneck speed\\n- Jawdropping pixel art and animation\\n- Funky retro-electro soundtrack\\n\\n[b] Personal cons [/b]\\n- none, go play it'},\n",

At first, I was kind of \"eh\" about it, felt a little janky at first. For the first 10 minutes that is.\\n\\nViolence. Speed. Momentum.\\n\\nThis game is definitely on my personal top 3 even though it could take you about 3 hours to beat the entire thing. And I\\'m aware, as of right now when I\\'m writing this review, I only have like 11 hours on this game, that\\'s plenty to make a point for me. Already I have beaten this game three times, and I would never mind going for a fourth, fith, or thirtieth.\\nThe game play just feels so smooth, so fluid, just so natural that it\\'s like a drug you can\\'t quit. You can almost feel the time around you slow as you progress through the levels, slaughtering everything in your path. It\\'s almost like those replays you had never existed to begin with and there was only the end product of what you were able to accomplish, completing the level.\\nIf you don\\'t care for the story that much, you will MOST DEFINITELY care for the game play. There is so much detail, so much diversity in such simple levels. So many different ideas that aren\\'t reused, but used very well, effectively. Everything feels unique in this game, like there is a purpose to everything you find and see, nothing feels left out, everything is used.\\nAlso forgot to add, putting this edit in- the music. I cannot stress how good the music is, and I\\'ll be 100% honest, I do not care for the soundtracks that come with small games like this, like FTL or hotline miami? Don\\'t care for it, honestly, and I\\'m sorry, I just don\\'t care. It\\'s not that I don\\'t like it, it\\'s just I really don\\'t care. This soundtrack though? By itself, I honestly wouldn\\'t care for it, with this game? It\\'s FLAWLESS. It fits so well, it feels like your katana controls the beat, the flow of the song, and the momentum of how fast it goes, or how slow it goes. My favorite track though, it\\'s gotta be the Dragon\\'s track. It\\'s just a beat, that\\'s all it is, but it just fits so well, you can FEEL the overbearing power that the Dragon has, how strong he is, how quick he is, how VIOLENT he is.\\n10/10, absolute masterpiece and I CANNOT wait for the DLC follow up of chapter 2.'},\n",

Fast-paced small levels, micro-timed fighting scenes with such variation in how you\\'re able to complete the level, whether it\\'s throwing a bottle of cutting someone in flashy slow-mo off a wall while doing a backflip. Yeah... maybe a bit overexaggerated. Keeping up with the [b] ACTION [/b] on the screen might be a bit hard for a rookie, but if you\\'re familiar with Hotline Miami series, this is a darn blast game for you!\\n[b]+ Replay-ability [/b]. Now. I wouldn\\'t call this a \"New Game+\" thing. Rather just the amazing amount of story background you can get. Everything counts, from your patience, to your choices. Stealth or Genocide. Life or Death. Good boy cosplayer or a \"F### you\" killer.\\n[b]+ Soundtrack [/b]. Yes, Hotline Miami notes in every track. Feel so good and pumped up. Pleasing concert to anyone\\'s ears.\\n[b]+ This is worth your money.[/b] 15$ Is a fair price for this game. Trust me.\\n\\nUPDATE 31.05.2019!!!\\n[b]+ Yesterday this got updated with new SPEEDRUN and HARDCORE modes, I couldn\\'t simply walk past this update and not point out how much it brings to the game. I can predict some frame perfect speedruns [spoiler](because that\\'s possible due to ability to disable \"unpredictabilty\" of the game, where all enemies and bosses have exactly same patterns every time)[/spoiler]. Hardcore mode brings new enemies and faster thinking AI. Also have fun going speedrunning with your slowmotion ability off!!\\n\\nCons:\\n[b]- Something still feels off. Maybe because they still haven\\'t told us the whole story behind it... there\\'s something hinting on second part. *Wink* [/b]\\n\\n===================================================\\nSo to sum up. This is a great game with great visuals and soundtrack. Fast-paced rogue-like HotlineMiami-like game with good. Really good story line, [i]if you pay attention[/i].'},\n",

You never notice one without the other. The game plays off your senses.\\n\\nCombat - Game feels solid, hack and slash how you want it to be. I find myself feeling like every now and then my slow motion was triggering, but this game is so fast paced you forget about it really quickly\\n\\nGameplay - The game handled nicely, the only few issues I ran into was when going down a level, I struggle with that in many platformers though, so I doubt it's a real issue. I found the final boss significantly more infuriating than 'fun'. Understandably the game is not about fun. But I found myself having no clue who I was fighting, as names came and went so quickly. The boss seemed hard just because she was insanely overpowered. Which puts a level of difficulty into the game that sort of just hit you like a wall. \\n\\nStory - Story was very fluid, I like how you could make a choice midway through, and whichever choice you made, you could still continue with the other choice is you wanted to. \\n\\nCharacters - They were well rounded, each with their own personality just through how they talked and the texts were highlighted, you could really tell what type of person you were facing, just through a few pixels. Excellent work.\\n\\nOverall - I nice quick play, looking forward to a sequel\\n\\n8.5/10\"},\n",

The controls are tight and fully purposed, the soundtrack is groovy, the art is colorful and expressive, and the story is gripping. It uses all of its elements elegantly, however, it feels like only a third of the plot is presented in the game, then baits for a sequel. The game is a slice of something with all the right flavors. I adore everything about it, but it just halts itself at a point that makes the story feel unfulfilling upon completion.\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"I'm not much of a platform hack and slash fan but I enjoyed Katana Zero a lot. The rewind mechanic alone makes for an interesting gameplay element (the fights are less stressful but at the same time it's a bit of a challenge to do things perfect). To elaborate on that: one hit and you are dead in this game. But you can always restart the current scene over again until you managed to get things right. You can also slow down time in critical situations to deflect bullets and similar.\\n\\nHowever, I mostly enjoyed the story and beautiful retro graphics. Without revealing too much it's pretty tense with a couple of interesting plot twists. Your dialogue choice also feel like they actually matter. At least sometimes they definitely are. Kata Zero does a very good job here.\\n\\nIn total it took me 6 hours to complete the game. Afterwards you can still do speed runs (there's a new game+ mode for that) or replay the story and try to do things differently. Out of curiosity, to unlock the secret end game boss or simply for achievement hunting. Truth be told, I'm satisfied with just having finished the game.\\n\\nI tend to rate games on how much I paid for them in relation to how long I played them. The ratio isn't very good here but there's games that just deserve a special place. And Katana Zero is one of them. Hopefully they'll make a sequel one day.\"},\n",

Go play it![/b]\\n\\n\\nI====.======___I\\nThis game is fantastic, Go play it!\\n[b]> Oh okay, Let\\'s see how I think of this game. Katana Zero...[/b]\\n\\n\\nGameplay-wise. It\\'s a 2D fast-paced action game focusing on close-combat. You die in one hit and also kill non-bosses enemies in one or a few hit(s). But the main mechanic of this game make you respawn right at the beginning of each short sections after you die, so you can retry the fight again and again without nuisances of long trek while also encourage trial and error gameplay. The game also give you power similar to \"bullet time\" and make use of slash attack to deflect enemies bullet with almost \"split-second\" precision (very satisfying if you succeed deflecting without bullet time). \\n\\nMission Stages in this game are divided into short sections. Each sections let you approach obstacles in different ways and also let you see your \"replay\" after finishing a section so you can relish the moment you pull off those stylish action moves again (or...like me... those funny \"Oh wait! I survive!?\" moment). Using controller, the control is very responsive and fluid, making spot on performance!\\n\\nWhile the gameplay is superb for the most part, there are some problem with this game. The stealth section of one section could be frustrating more than challenging for some especially those who wish to make a perfect stealth run of that stage because it require so much pixel perfect reaction time at the end of the last section (I retried this section even more times than when fighting end boss). Also while this game promote using various methods but at the endgame ([spoiler]yes that elevator level[/spoiler]) it narrow down your method into 1-2 constricted ways. While this is cool by it\\'s own I still think if the game let player acquire a new power or a new creative environmental interaction it would make that section more interesting and memorable.\\n\\nStory-wise. I like how this game make the protagonist power tied into the story and even played with by dialogue choices. This interesting take on dialogue choices helps setting tone and pacing of the game eventhough most of them seem like purely cosmetics. In between those heated, intense, brutal action gameplay there are some cooldown time with you roleplaying as Leon the Profe--- [i](Oh let rewind that) [/i]--- roleplaying as... herbal tea drinker with seemingly \"normal\" neighbours. \\n\\nWhile there are some good \"mind screw\" and deconstruction of videogame tropes here and there. There are also some cliches and some plot devices that feel disconnected I wish they will connect the dot for us in the sequel...yes this game is a sequel hook but it still has one big reveal at the end.  [spoiler]In which I think ...kind of predictable[/spoiler]\\n\\nVisual design is great for the genres and somewhat well-detailed (like blood splashes on the wall depend on how you kill enemies). Sound is okay... Music did it\\'s job. I really like peaceful and melancholy piano piece called \"Rain on Brick\" the most.\\n\\n[b]Overall, you won\\'t be disappointed if you buy this game for action-packed with considerable amount of challenging gameplay for a main course and let the story and dialogue choices be side-dishes.[/b]'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': 'This game is mechanically perfect. I have done basically everything i could possibly do with this game including speedrunning the game (for a relatively competitive time), modding the game and basically any challenge run you could think of. I\\'ve done this over about 500 hours across 3 different platforms and i enjoyed pretty much all of it because of the extreme depth in the mechanics.\\n\\nIn the story department the game is [i] not [/i] perfect. People will swear by this game saying things like \"it\\'s the best story I\\'ve ever seen in a video game\" or \"the characters in this story made me cry, it\\'s so beautiful\". However if you are in any way a fan of well thought out intricate stories then this game is not for you. The game sets up SO MANY plot devices and plot threads and resolves almost none of them. The world is so large and has so many details however almost none of them are explained. This isn\\'t just your average \"it\\'s up to interpretation story\" because i actually like those as they give you the information you need to solve the answers to questions yourself. This game is different because it is LITERALLY unfinished by design. The game is getting a free DLC that was announced way back when the game first released that should (apparently) answer some questions left by the main game. The ONLY reason this is a positive review is because 1) the speedrunning community is great and helped me enjoy the game way more than i did on my first playthrough, and 2) the promised DLC. If it were not for these two things then the story would be unforgivable for me because it\\'s almost as if it\\'s just 6 hours of setting up for another few hours of crazy conclusions to everything, that just finishes out of nowhere.\\n\\nIt\\'s a real shame because they have something so perfect with the gameplay, i can only hope that they dont fuck it up with an unfinished story. This reveiw will be updated after the dlc drops (likely soon now but i also said that two years ago so who knows), if the story isn\\'t fixed by then it will probably be a negative one.'},\n",

They're working on a free DLC that will continue the story, so don't let the shortness of the game scare you away.\\n\\nThe gameplay is very satisfying:\\n--The time slowing ability was implemented pretty well and is useful throughout your first play through, but you can also get through without using it.\\n--The post-game challenges are actually pretty touch. Hard mode and the Gold Medal achievement will satisfy anyone who wasn't challenged by the base game, and the Speedrun mode is pretty versatile in the amount of options it gives you.\\n--The feeling of slicing through bad guys, deflecting bullets, slashing down doors, and nailing enemies with throwable is very satisfying, but if you dislike the slight freeze when killing someone, you can turn it off, which was useful for the Gold Medal achievement.\\n\\nThe story mode was fun and interesting:\\n--Personally, when I can tell that the developers and writers put love into their project, it's very easy for me to get attached to characters and be interested in the story. The game is very goofy (often, bad guys will be conversing before you make your presence known, and the conversations you have with the different characters in cutscenes can be fun), but the darker undertones keep you grounded in the severity of your situation.\\n--The game's secret boss (I won't talk about it for obvious reasons) opens up a lot of questions, and it was also one of the hardest challenges in the game, especially in hard mode.\\n\\nThe game overall was just a fun experience albeit being short (100% achievements in around 20 hours isn't very long for a game). The length is honestly one of my only complaints, but I'm not stressing it because the devs are going to continue adding to the game. The ending and the secrets did a good job of making me want more, and I can definitely see why this game has an Overwhelmingly Positive rating.\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': '[h1] It\\'s Like a Gory Version of Celeste [/h1]\\nThis game RIPS so hard and really embodies the idea of a \"combat puzzle\" game. Most rooms require you to evaluate the situation and find the correct plan of action, and then execute that plan of action with decent window in-between each action. Choosing which enemy to kill first, which barrels to shoot, whether or not you should stealth a section, the game has plenty of variety in approaching situations and its amazing. Some of the situations do offer quite a bit of challenge, especially the boss fights.\\n\\nThat\\'s just the gameplay though, the small segments in-between each killing floor really flesh this game out even further. The dialogue options you are given when speaking with the \"therapist\", the small talk you can make with the receptionist, it\\'s not necessary at all but the fact that it\\'s there elevates the series tremendously. The story is also fantastic, with you questioning \"What the fuck is going on?\" quite often. I got very invested in the story and I eagerly await the DLC. \\n\\nThe 2D art style is also fantastic. The blood and gore in the scenes look great. My only detractor from the game would be that the stealth sections are kind of a drag if you choose that route. Dying requires you to keep doing them over again and waiting, but you do always have the option of going weapons loud. It\\'s just you\\'ll have to deal with the potential story consequences later.\\n\\n[b] I would HEAVILY recommend that everyone pick-up this indie classic!

I'm only a couple hours in and I'm loving the story and decision making during conversations. The restarting is very quick and necessary, I found that turning off the rewind sfx helped with the constant rewinds as I figure out the best way to clear a room. When you get the right sequence down boy is it satisfying. So please take this as an early review, I haven't finished this game or seen all it has to offer but I picked it up on sale and it's been worth every penny so far. Art style and animation is great for a pixel based game, one of the nicest I've seen. Music is very fitting of the mood. Controls aren't just tight, they feel intuitive and simple to get the hang of. Mastering this and timing your attacks are where your skills will come into play and some cool tricks can be pulled off with some practice or you could take a more stealthy route instead. I can see myself playing through several times to see what effects my decisions and play style make. All in all a very enjoyable game so far.\\nEdited to add: \\nI've finished the game now and have seen all Katana Zero has to offer until the next update, yet I continue to play because I know I can do better on each stage. I'm 42 years old, been playing games since 1981. I play using an arcade stick because it works so well for me compared to controller. This is in my top 20 games of all time. Buy it.\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': 'In this game you play as Zero from Megaman as he lives in a world only for Reploids and that\\'s why he\\'s in his bathrobe. Zero is tasked by Megaman to kill a bunch of people including John \"El Barbón\" Rose and Daft Punk. He does this by throwing statues at them, even though he has a katana.\\n\\nA sudden guest appearance by V from Vendetta changed everything for Zero. Now I\\'ve never played Vendetta before in my life, but I\\'m assuming this game is just being lore accurate when they made V really creepy, like stalking Zero everywhere and forcing him to do unsolicited home video reviews. Thankfully he was put to his place by Zero, but he was also rescued by a random indoor blizzard. It\\'s respectably topical, but I believe if they\\'re going to bring climate change into this game, they\\'d do well to expand it a bit more. Maybe in the DLC.\\n\\nAnyway, the protagonist Megaman from Zero isn\\'t quite done yet with V so he went to Silent Hill and befriended an exploding robot in a minecart race so he can throw a statue at him. This does not work, so he hopped on a bike until V stopped having hands in being a creep. It was a rough day in general for Megaman, but it turns out it wasn\\'t over yet because THEN another dude sent his own video for reviews. At this point Megaman began to consider a full profession shift, but after a really deep and introspective scene full of imageries and symbolisms, Miamiman decided he\\'d rather kill people than be a movie critic.\\n\\nBut also it turns out, Megaman Zero had sucked in his job and his boss is really mad, so his boss gave him one final job or else he will be turned into former-Reploid. Now Zeroman had to play children\\'s card games (he was really good at it) and set himself on fire in an elevator to truly prove that he was the best in the business. In doing so though only more questions came over to his mind: If he was really good at children\\'s card games... why is he a cosplayer? Stuff like this is what makes Katanaman truly the Michaelangelo of our time; you have a man torn between what he is (bathrobe), what people expect of him (video review), and what he really, truly is (card game for children). He was torn all the way to the end of the game, with trippy scenes symbolizing his inner struggles, culminating in his confrontation against Signas who shoots needles out of his Mega Buster.\\n\\nIn an unexpected twist by the end you can also unlock the Mastery Sword, revealing the game to be a part of the Legend of Zelda franchise. This is why the title of the game has the name of its protagonist: Zelda. In short, Katana Zelda is a really good game, and I fully recommend it to anyone else who likes Akira Kurosawa classics, such as Samurai Champloo.\\n\\nPS: John Wick is in this game but he\\'s blonde with a katana and goes by \"Fifteen\". He still has his signature suit though, and he goes around seeking revenge and shooting dog videos or something idk I didn\\'t play Katana Zero.\\n\\n0/15 Best Katana Jack I ever played.'},\n",

It is all outstanding. \\n  Thanks to all involved in the development of the game for bringing us such a gem and keep at it\"},\n",

This game I was a little skeptical of given the praise it received and the general style it was going for.  All of that said, it\\'s actually really good.\\nThe story has that hyper violent hotline miami feel, the stage progression even feels a little bit like it.  You have the after mission apartment scene, you have to perfect one floor at a time, and you have an unreliable nararator.  That said the formula works.\\nAfter you complete a room surviving, you get to see what \"everyone\" else saw while you were slowing down and rewinding time.  That mechanic reminded me of super time force ultra.  \\nThe game has dialogue trees which are interesting and fun.  I don\\'t believe they change anything long term but it changes \"who\" your character is by who you make them behave as and it makes certain events more relevant than others.\\nFor the controls they are tight and the game feels super easy at first but very quickly you find yourself clearing out rooms that seem impossible at first with like 10 guys with shotguns in them and a guy with a minigun and when you see the replay you feel a sense of joy knowing you overcome it.\\nThe game feels like it took inspiration from many different games but it also innovates sufficiently and has what I think is a really cool and somewhat twisted story.  I thoroughly enjoyed the game and have to recommend it.\\nEdit: I have to amend what I said, quite a few details change given how you complete missions and in one stage the narrative is quite different if you dodge cameras.  There is one particularly ruthless scene you can completely change the outcome of which is awesome.'},\n",

It is so dynamic, so sometimes there is no time to think, and you need to trust your reflexes, but when you die many times, you will get used to it, so there is no problem. The duration of the game is not long, and it is the best choice for this game because the map design of the game may bore after many hours, so they chose the correct duration for this game. Even though the map design was good on the first look, it is the same when you die or restart the game. That is why it may bore the players. Secondly, I was curious about the story which made my experience better. Also, you can see the effects of the choices during the game, so it is not the first time in-game history, but good. Lastly, the tape of the fifteen was so fun, and I want to see how we will see Snow. (The game was good.)'},\n",

The gameplay is super tightly designed and I only have like 1 issue that comes to mind which is the levels with press machines that slam and raise on a timer.

The game is admittedly very short and it goes on sale often, but the gameplay is super fun and it's very replayable if you're the kind of person who likes perfecting their runs. I'd say you're fine buying it for $15 it's pretty worth not to mention there's an upcoming content update (free DLC and god I wish we didn't normalize the existence of DLC by replacing content updates with that word).

But i can honestly say that i havent had such an amazing gaming experience in a while. Beautiful art design, amazing music and outstanding story telling. The controls are tight and the gameplay is really fun. \\n\\nThe game is a mix between platformer and hack\\'n slay. You dont have a health bar and one hit will result in an instant death. But the twist is that you can, in a way, control time. And that can lead to some really ludicrous combos and in my opinion mostly fun gameplay. \"Mostly\" because levels with a larger size can sometimes become very challenging and made me feel frustrated at times. Especially since the game can sometimes demand perfect timing.\\n\\nOther than that i had a really great time. The story is rather short with about 4-5 hours. But that didnt really bother me at all. Because these 5 hours i was at the edge of my seat the entire time. Thanks to the amazing story telling, story itself, music and art. \\n\\nThe performance was perfect which is probably no surprise but worth mentioning. And the price tag with 12,49€ is in my opionion more than fair. \\n\\nTo wrap this up: \\nKatana ZERO was a very unique and fantastic game experience. It almost felt like art at times. I was mesmerized and astonished about it from the beginning up until the very end. \\nSo if you are looking for something new and/or fresh or maybe just a great story to dive into then i can highly recommand Katana ZERO.'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': 'Öncelikle şunu belirtmek istiyorum genelde bu tarz 2D oyunlar hikayesinden çok oynanış mekanikleri ile öne çıkarken bana göre bu oyunun en vurucu kısmı hikayesi. Benim açımdan harika bir olay oldu bu çünkü ben oyunlarda hikaye arayan bir insanım. Kısaca hikayeyi özetlemek gerekirse ‘The Dragon‘ lakaplı bir acımasız bir samurayı yönetiyoruz. The Dragon öldüreceği kişileri psikiyatrı tarafından öğreniyor. Yani bir diğer deyişle psikiyatr bizim patronumuz. Fakat tek işlevi bize görev veren boş bir NPC değil. Kendisi aynı zamanda bizim hafızamızı kazanmamıza yardım ediyor. Psikiyatrın anlattığına göre The Dragon, hafızasını yıllar önce yaşanan büyük bir savaşta kaybediyor ve The Dragon‘ın gazi olarak döndüğü bu savaş bizlere de oyun için de ufak ufak anlatılıyor.\\n\\nThe Dragon hafıza kaybı yaşamış olsa dahi her gece kabus görüyor. Bu çok gerçekçi kabuslar yüzünden sabahları kalktığında gerçek ve rüya arasında yaşıyor. Bunun için her psikiyatra gidişinde kendisi bize sakinleştirici bir iğne veriyor. Bundan sonrası hakkında da konuşmak isterdim fakat bundan sonra yaşanan her olayda ekrana ağzınız açık bakıyorsunuz. Aynı zamanda şunu belirtmek istiyorum oyunda diyalog seçimleri var fakat hikayenin sonunu etkilemektense sadece hikaye sunumunu etkiliyor. Size cevap vermeniz için kısıtlı bir zaman veriliyor ve bu süre içerisinde bir diyalog seçmek zorundasınız. Diyaloglara çok hızlı cevap verirseniz karşınızdaki kişinin konuşmasını bölmek gibi değişik bir sunuma da sahip.\\n\\nTabii hikayeyi bu kadar övdüm ama eksi yönleri de var. Oyunun hikayesi yarım kalıyor ve öyle bir yerde bitiyor ki kendi kendinizi yiyorsunuz. Şaka yapmıyorum 3 gece boyunca her akşam hikaye nasıl devam edecek onu düşündüm uyumadan önce.

Modern pixel art graphics blend with a self-aware homage to the cliche of early 90s side scrollers make the atmosphere both nostalgic and fresh at the same time.\\n\\nThe story, which I won't talk about (because spoilers) is awesome and kept me playing for several hours before I realized it.\\n\\nHighly recommend.\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': 'Katana Zero is a game from Askiisoft, giving a fast-paced action platformer with a large amount of style. It has what appears to be a novel new take on the genre, and is both punishing and superb once the player starts to master the technique.\\n\\nIt also is a game that feels like it has two distinct ideas about the experience, though the second half is clearly where the game excels.\\n\\nKatana Zero starts with a simple level and a unique premise. The player is playing a samurai-looking character, who I’ll just refer to as “The Samurai” to avoid any major discussion of the plot points. The Samurai can plan out his attacks on each level. The goal is to kill all the enemies and progress to the next stage. The key to this is that enemies will follow the same paths given the same stimulus, and the player also gets a small ability to slow down time.\\n\\nEnemies are dangerous, as The Samurai is given no life meter, and a single mistake will spell his death, but because it’s only a “planning scenario” in his mind, he can attempt multiple run-throughs of the same level. Once a working plan is in place, the game then shows the character completing the level in black and white footage, likely done to imply it’s a recording.\\n\\nAs a concept this sounds novel and fresh; in practice, it’s less so. While the concept does give a thematic way to explain why the player can die multiple times without actually dying or having some fake construct such as “lives”, it’s done more for the story’s sake as a way to explain a few scenes later. The replay of your actions though is the bigger problem as it seems like it’s a way for the game to extend its run time in the worst way. The few replays I watched had me saying “That’s exactly what I did less than a minute ago, what’s the point?” Again this is done for a single-story scene far later, and while the replay is skippable, it doesn’t add much to the experience.\\n\\nThe gameplay of the “planning session” is excellent though. The controls are extremely tight, the combat is fast, and the player feels like he’s both powerful at times, such as being able to deflect bullets back at enemies who shoot at him, and powerless, such as when an enemy shoots a shotgun with multiple pellets.\\n\\nThe core gameplay loop is fast, where The Samurai has to keep on his toes to be sure to dodge attacks, deliver fatal blows, and more, and since everything dies in one hit, players can tear through enemies always aware the one misstep will restart the level.\\n\\nThe first few levels are run of the mill but by the end of the game, there are enough tricks, traps, and different enemies that each level will be both challenging and interesting to travel through. The only level I found to be lacking was a stealth level that worked but required a few techniques the game didn’t teach directly.\\n\\nThe same is true for the story. While the first third or half of the story is relatively ordinary at times, it introduces the player to major elements of the game, it’s about a third of the way through the game, where the story seems to buck the trend and enter into a deeply disturbing and suspenseful thriller. Once the story picks up, the entire experience of Katana Zero comes alive.\\n\\nI’ll forgo a major analysis of the story because it should be experienced from scratch, and after watching the full game, the first third of the game makes sense as it sets up the character’s world. But the story also has a big issue.\\n\\nThe game has its major crescendo in the final level and feels like there’s perhaps one final level to tie up loose ends. However, that’s not to be. Instead, the game ends on not one but two massive cliffhangers, leading players to a “To be continued” screen.\\n\\nThe issue is this doesn’t feel like a complete story. While a game like the original God of War was set up to be a trilogy, or at least have a sequel, God of War itself contained a full story that had a beginning, middle, and end. Katana Zero doesn’t contain a full ending, or rather it has all the pieces for it, but the story leaves enough major parts of its ending opening that it becomes unsatisfying.\\n\\nOf course, while looking back at the first four or five levels from the story aspect makes sense, it’s also about a third of the game where the player may become uninterested. With the game only hitting its stride after that section, it takes the player a couple of hours to get the major feeling of the experience. Up to that point, it’s a relatively average platformer, with enemies that won’t challenge the player too much.\\n\\nOnce the player can get past the opening section, Katana Zero will knock them off their feet with the visuals, story, and music. The gameplay is tight that there are a few sections in the final levels that were a pure joy to play. Katana Zero does get extremely good and ends on a very strong note, it takes a good amount of the four to six-hour run time to get there, and has trouble nailing the landing after those final moments.\\n\\nI ultimate give Katana Zero an arbitrary\\n\\n7/10\\n\\nI look forward to a future DLC and likely sequel, but I also think there could have been a move to tell the full story in a single title, rather than releasing what feels like 80 percent of the full tale in one game.\\n\\nIf you enjoyed this and want to see more from me, you can check out my youtube channel at\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/KinglinkReviews'},\n",

Both have an amazing synthwave soundtrack that perfectly synchronizes with the onscreen art and action. However, where Katana Zero stands out is how it implements the death mechanics into the story line and gameplay. Rather than serving as a gameplay mechanic, the story revolves around your character\\'s ability to seemingly control time. \\n\\nThe story, due to how it handles this mechanic, is bizarre and scattered and it is left to the player to piece together through the dialogue and environment. Do not underestimate the dialogue system either, smashing continue will result in you insulting the characters as you essentially throw away the story to save a few meaningless minutes. A broad synopsis would be this: You are a warrior for hire, and your employer tasks you to kill various workers and as a reward for a successful job, you are given your \"medicine\". However, as you continue you regain past memories you begin to uncover that there is much more going on behind the scenes.\\n\\nTo summarize everything:\\n[list]\\n[*]The art style and synthwave soundtrack blend perfectly with the gameplay\\n[*]Characters are colorful, easy to get attached to, and they too are tied to the death-mechanics.\\n[*]Story is fantastic and weird and may take a more than a single playthrough before you can really start to figure out what is going on\\n[*]Instant-death mechanics encourage many, many deaths until you get it right, and will require paitence.\\n[*]Your choices matter with a branching dialogue system that will keep track of the dialogue you\\'ve skipped\\n[/list]'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"[i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/35145066/] Feel free to follow my review page![/url][/i]\\n\\n[h1]The gist of it:[/h1]\\nKatana ZERO is sadly an underwhelming experience, a 2D action game with combat similar to Hotline Miami due to the instant death mechanic but with a sword-wielding main character and a story that will probably continue in future sequels, offering nothing truly interesting. \\n\\n👍 [u]The good parts:[/u]\\n-A decent soundtrack that pumps you up during combat. \\n-The story is interesting enough. \\n-Gameplay can be hard at times but ultimately fun.\\n\\n👎[u]The bad parts:[/u]\\n-While the story is interesting, it is riddled with plot holes, feels incomplete and it expects us to wait for a sequel in a 4-hour indie game.\\n-The art style and overall locations are generally not that interesting to look at. \\n-Too short.\\n \\n[h1]Story[/h1]\\nKatana ZERO's story is a messed up mystery that bit by bit it unfolds up until the end. It does keep things interesting and makes you guess but sadly once it ends it just leaves things up in the air, ultimately leaving us unsatisfied with its conclusion. \\n\\nGenerally, I'm glad when a good game gets a sequel however the way the story is presented in Katana ZERO, it pretty much feels cut in half. For an indie game that's a no-no in my books, especially for a 3-4 hour game. The only redeeming quality is that the story feels rather cool and intriguing and I do want to learn what the hell the whole deal is with the main character and his background. \\n\\nStory rating: 7/10\\n\\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\\nThe gameplay is fun, no doubt about it, and it can get frustrating in some occasions however it is nothing special. It keeps the game entertaining until the end but I wish they would've made things more complex with the levels or combat design.\\n\\nAs it is, it's a fun instant death hack and slash with some cool boss fights, a game that does not try to impress you but rather wants you to simply enjoy it. Once you get the hang of it, things get easier even if the game puts you in tough spots and by the end of it you're just breezing through it like it's nothing. \\n\\nGameplay rating:  7.5/10\\n\\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\\nMy main expectation when I bought the game was the soundtrack. Since you can clearly see some similarities with Hotline Miami and the way the protagonists puts on his music player before the level, I honestly was expecting some amazing synth-like songs only to be disappointed. \\n\\nThe songs are not bad, they're actually good enough but nowhere near my level of hype, but I guess that's my fault. \\n\\nThere is no voice acting in the game and the sound effects are pretty much average.\\n\\nAudio rating:  7.5/10\\n\\n[h1]Graphics, performance and tech analysis[/h1]\\nThe game runs perfectly as expected from a 2D pixel game and there were no major or minor bugs to encounter.\\n\\nThe art style and overall atmosphere/level design are left to be desired. I never once stopped to admire the pixelated backgrounds or the levels themselves. They never truly shine, unfortunately. At best they're okay. \\n\\nGraphics, performance and tech analysis score: 7/10\\n\\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\\nHonestly, I was expecting something more, maybe it's my own fault for getting hyped for something similar to Hotline Miami and while Katana ZERO certainly isn't a bad game at all, it really isn't that special and the only interesting thing going for it, sadly is unfinished and cut in half. I suppose you should wait for the sequel if they ever decide to make one and then get both, else you'll just start and finish an incomplete experience. The price is at least low so that's a good thing. \\n\\n[h1]Final score: 7.25/10[/h1]\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': '[b][u]This game was reviewed using Version 1.0.5. Your experience on other versions may vary.[/u][/b]\\n\\n[h3][b][u]Short Answer:[/u][/b][/h3] A fast-paced action platformer dripping with style and quality at (almost) every turn. The gameplay, art direction, and soundtrack are all stellar; and the only sore spot for me is the fact that its otherwise captivating story is, as of writing this, incomplete (but may be resolved with the promised free DLC). An absolute blast to play, and getting a resolution to the story would likely cement it as one of my all-time favorites.\\n\\n[b][u]NOTE[/u]: Players with photosensitive epilepsy will probably need to skip this one due to rapid flashing imagery and intense visual effects, which might be too much even after disabling all relevant graphical settings.[/b]\\n\\n[h3][b][u]Long Answer:[/u][/b][/h3] [i]Katana ZERO[/i] is an action platformer where you play as a swordsman with the power of precognition, able to foresee possible futures and determine the path to survival in even the deadliest encounters. He works as a killer for hire for a secret organization with equally secret motives, but his newest string of missions will force him to question everything he thought he knew--but to say anything beyond that would do the story, and you, a disservice. I\\'ll be blunt and say that I had a lot of fun with this game; and were it not for one glaring flaw--one that may be resolved in the not-too-distant future--I would probably consider this one of my favorite games in recent years.\\n\\nGameplay consists of a bit of platforming and a lot of fast-paced hack-and-slash combat, where a single hit from an enemy will kill you and send you back to the start of the level. Your only weapon is a katana that you can swing in all directions, but you\\'ve got a few other tricks up your sleeve as well: you can throw small objects to kill enemies, dodge roll through obstacles, deflect bullets with your blade, and even slow down time to pull off tricky stunts more easily. [b]It\\'s a game that expects you to die often[/b], even setting up traps to force trial and error on occasion; [b]but it\\'s relatively frustration-free despite that[/b]. Individual level segments are small and everything moves at a brisk pace, so dying never costs you more than maybe 60 seconds of progress at most. It also ties nicely into the story: the gameplay segments are framed as being visions from your character\\'s future sight and don\\'t actually go into effect until you\\'ve successfully cleared the level, making death feel less like a failure state and more like an extension of the narrative. It doesn\\'t sound like much, but stuff like this can go a long way towards reducing stress even when the gameplay is at its toughest. As someone who can get easily frustrated with games at times, I can only count one or two sections where I felt even mildly annoyed despite dying a few hundred times in my playthrough.\\n\\nThis doesn\\'t have much to do with the normal gameplay, but I want to briefly mention the unique dialogue system, because it took me by surprise in a very good way. You have the ability to pick one of several dialogue choices whenever you enter a conversation, and these choices can change depending on how fast you choose to respond. Waiting until someone finishes their block of text will give you the standard responses, but interjecting early lets you pick a more direct or aggressive response that can change the direction of the whole conversation or even end it prematurely. This system is even used [spoiler]as a puzzle mechanic in the mid-game, and you can unlock some hidden achievements and late-game content depending on the choices you make[/spoiler]. It might not be that big of a deal for most players, but I thought it was really cool and deserved some recognition.\\n\\nThe solid gameplay loop alone might\\'ve been enough for me to recommend, but they went ahead and knocked it out of the park in nearly every other aspect of its design as well. [b]The visuals are just fantastic[/b], making the most of its pixel art style with detailed environments, gorgeous color palettes, great use of shading, and surprisingly fluid animations. Everything is full of visual flair, even down to the text boxes and their range of effects and animations that emphasize the tone of a conversation so nothing is left to the imagination. [b]The music is also great[/b], and it\\'s actually the thing that first put the game on my radar. It features a lot of techno music straight out of an \\'80s-inspired cyberpunk/outrun playlist, while sprinkling in some jazz and atmospheric electronic tracks to punctuate the calm moments that break up the action. On both fronts, it\\'s some of the best of its kind.\\n\\nContinuing the theme, [b]the story matches the same high quality as everything else...for the most part[/b]. It was interesting, full of twists and turns, and managed to utilize--and sometimes even manipulate--every other element I\\'ve mentioned previously to tell a story that I don\\'t think could ever be told through anything other than a video game. With all that said, there is one big thing going against it, one that I could understand being a dealbreaker for some players: [b]as of writing this, the story is incomplete[/b]. It ends on a cliffhanger, without resolving the bulk of its biggest plot threads, leaving behind only a \"To Be Continued\" since it originally launched four years ago. Now, they [i]have[/i] been working on free DLC that\\'s said to be over half the size of the base game, so presumably we\\'ll get our conclusion from that whenever it finally comes out. Until then, be warned that your playthrough may end on a low note as you experience the same \"Wait, is that it?\" moment that I did.\\n\\n[b]You can beat the game in 4-5 hours, but doing so offers multiple opportunities to extend your playtime if you\\'re looking for more[/b]: hard mode, speedrun mode, a bunch of easily missed hidden achievements to unlock, and even an April Fool\\'s update that completely rewrites the story (details on accessing that [url=https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/460950/view/6660301466800760588]here[/url]). It\\'s stylish, it\\'s exhilerating, it\\'s an absolute treat to the eyes and ears, and most important of all, it\\'s just downright fun to play. [b][u]Although I was disappointed by the story\\'s unfinished state, the quality of the rest of the experience is just high enough that [i]Katana ZERO[/i] still gets a thumbs up from me--and if the future DLC wraps the story up right, it\\'ll become one of my easiest recommendations to date.[/u][/b]\\n\\n[quote]For more game reviews, check out my [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42524563/]Curator page[/url]![/quote]'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': 'There are a lot of comparisons of this game to Hotline Miami, and it is for good reason. I would say that this game took everything I liked about Hotline Miami and dialed it up to 10. The primitive-looking (but charming) character sprites are replaced by really beautiful, well-animated characters. The action can be just as frantic, although the time-slowing mechanic in Katana ZERO is very welcome and makes you feel even cooler when you deflect an enemy\\'s bullets back at them. The story is just as mysterious, but a lot more coherent. Maybe for some this is a bad thing... but I like being able to tell what\\'s going on in a game without reading a wiki. The music in both games is great and I\\'m not sure I could say which I like better, but that\\'s a big compliment to both games anyway.\\n\\nOverall, this is a really, really solid action game. I wouldn\\'t recommend getting it if other \"hard\" action games haven\\'t been your thing before. There is definitely a gameplay loop of dying a few times when you first feel out a level, improve, and then conquer it. I wouldn\\'t say there\\'s any level that feels unfair, but you will definitely die a lot, so if that kind of thing hurts your ego, be careful with this one! What I really enjoy about the levels is that many of them are designed for you to have multiple pathways or ways to take out the enemy. You can just kick down a door and go in swinging your sword, or you can break into an upper area, collect weapons, and get the drop on them from above.Even the bosses have sort of a free-flowing style to them. As long as you can dodge their attacks and find an opening, odds are there are multiple ways to beat them.\\n\\nWithout saying a ton about the story, it got a lot darker than I was expecting, and the themes it talked about/how it explains the protagonist\\'s powers were all very interesting to follow. I also initially disliked the dialogue system when I first saw it, but it grew on me, and ended up being really effective at encouraging players to pay attention to dialogue instead of mashing the space bar to skip through everything.\\n\\nIf I had any main criticism of the game right now, it would be that, yeah, it is pretty short. However, after reading up on it, I understand that the developers are going to add more chapters/content as free DLC, so there\\'s that. Very good, too, because the story as I wrote this review ends on a pretty disappointing cliffhanger! As long as future updates finish this story with THIS game and it\\'s not put into a sequel or anything, I don\\'t see why this game doesn\\'t deserve its recommendation from me.\\n\\n'},\n",

In Katana ZERO, the brilliant visual design, the amazing audio engineering and music, the mind blowing plot, and gameplay, and the illuminated meta narrative all flow together simultaneously as an ingenious synergy. This game is, on the one hand, a classic and nostalgic 16-bit experience, and on the other hand merely uses nostalgia to cover up its true intentions, which is to force you to look square in the face of your own desire to play vidya, and confront the all-too-human drive within yourself to partake in glorified murder simulation. Like a slave to dopamine. Like a junkie. Now, get the HELL out of my office, you Goddamn junkie!'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"[h1] Katana Zero Review: A Time-Bending Tale of Redemption [/h1]\\n\\nHey there, it's Kenstagator, diving into the intriguing world of Katana Zero. \\n\\nLet's talk samurai assassins, time manipulation, and a dash of gory redemption.\\n\\nImagine a game that doesn't just embrace your failures, but practically celebrates them. That's Katana Zero in a nutshell. Developed by Askiisoft, this 2D side-scrolling action adventure thrusts you into the shoes of Zero, an amnesiac samurai with a deadly task and a unique ability to manipulate time thanks to a mind-bending drug.\\n\\nAs Zero, you gracefully dodge, slice, and deflect through stages, feeling like a true sword-wielding badass. Bullet time becomes your trusty companion, allowing you to orchestrate cinematic carnage with style. While the gameplay is solid, it does have its limitations. The combat, while polished, can feel a bit restrained due to a limited variety of enemies and environments.\\n\\nBut here's where it gets interesting. The game's repetitive nature isn't a flaw, it's a feature. You'll replay encounters multiple times to perfect your moves, fitting right into the theme of mastery through defeat. There's something oddly satisfying about nailing that scenario after a dozen attempts, but it can also start to feel a bit predictable.\\n\\nThe story adds layers to this repetition. Zero is no typical hero; he's a loner with a tragic reliance on Chronos, the time-altering drug. It's a double-edged sword – it grants power but exacts a heavy price. The story deftly explores the choices he faces: endless violence or a plunge into oblivion.\\n\\nInteractive moments and dialogue choices give you some control over Zero's journey. These segments, while not drastically affecting the main plot, deepen your connection with him and his struggles. The narrative unfolds against a backdrop of dark, meticulously animated scenes that blend seamlessly with the gameplay.\\n\\nThe game's atmosphere oozes neon-lit grit, with pulsating music enhancing both action-packed sequences and story-driven dialogues. Sure, Katana Zero can be a bit grim at times, and the gameplay variety isn't groundbreaking, but it still manages to captivate. The game's unique style and sincere storytelling make it stand out even in its cynical and sometimes ugly world.\\n\\nSo, if you're up for a dose of samurai action with a twist of time manipulation and a side of introspection, Katana Zero could be your next gaming adventure!\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"[h1] A masterpiece in samurai action game [/h1]\\n\\nKatana Zero is an excellent fast-paced hack'n'slash platform game. The pixel art is charming and its good sci-fi narrative fights with the excellent gameplay for being the best part of the game.\\n\\n This is a game that shines a lot during its story and allows the player to choose some lines during the game.[b] I recommend staying away from spoilers[/b]. Briefly, the game starts from the premise that the protagonist does not remember the past and currently works assassinating targets for his employer.\\n\\n The game has simple mechanics to learn but difficult to master, as your weapon is just a katana you are limited to killing your enemies quickly and short, being able to dodge rolling bullets or hitting them during their trajectory. The game's gimmick comes from the main ability to slow down time, allowing you to escape or even kill your enemies at crucial moments. Another factor is that failing is part of the game, progress is retained until you eliminate all enemies at once, and if you die you can start over from the beginning of the area and try again in another way.\\n\\n The game has a great replay factor, encouraging discovering secrets in the levels, finishing them faster and even increasing the difficulty with new enemies and unpredictable routes. The narrative also gains a lot from this, letting you experience several dialogues in different ways to explore the protagonist's story and the world in which he lives.\\n\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': '[b]Katana Zero[/b] is a fun, pixel-art game with simple but effective combat dynamics and a [i]well-written, easily followable plot[/i] (although it may not seem like it, everything is told pretty clearly).\\n\\n[h3]About combat and levels...[/h3]\\nIf you\\'ve ever played [b]Hotline Miami[/b], you\\'ll surely be familiar with this game\\'s combat loop. It\\'s really simple: you have your katana, you can pick up object to throw at your enemies and you have one life. If you get hit, [i]you\\'ll have to re-do the whole section[/i].  \\nIt\\'s easier than one might think, actually; in fact I struggled only in some specific segments, but for the most part it\\'s been [i]mildly challenging[/i], but never frustrating. That is, of course, for the normal mode. I can\\'t speak for the hard mode, but it has the potential to be [b]sweaty[/b].\\n\\nThe overall combat flow is [b]nice[/b]. You can dodge and briefly slow down time, allowing you to [i]counterattack[/i] your enemies\\' bullets or melee hits. It doesn\\'t get simpler than that, but it surely does bring up interesting situations, given that there are a few different enemy types, each one made to let you really get strategic at times. \\n\\nOh, and there are [i]throwable objects[/i]. Can\\'t say much about those. You have knives, bottles and special items such as flamethrowers and sticky detonators. You can get creative with that, too. \\n\\nLevel design is [b]solid[/b]. Each \"room\" has its own well-thought areas where you can set up different strategies. \\nThere were some easter eggs here and there, such as the [i]Quiet Hills[/i] floor on one of the levels: you\\'re into this frenetic ninja action and, all of a sudden, you find yourself with Pyramid Head in front of you. Your mind says \"crap.\", but then you realize it\\'s just a prop and you proceed. I found it funny. [i]Like that robot, for example[/i]. \\n\\n[h3]An interesting twist on storytelling[/h3]\\nWhile I find Katana Zero\\'s story to be pretty simple (but interesting nonetheless), I think that its major strength is in its [b]storytelling[/b]. \\nHaving your plot revolving around \"time\" basically gives you different approaches to choose from. And I think Askiisoft definitely have thought about this. Especially from half into the game.\\n\\nWhat\\'s interesting about these indie titles is that they show that you don\\'t need an extended lore to tell a story. It\\'s just what it is, and sometimes [i]it\\'s enough[/i]. Now, I can\\'t 100% say that it\\'s self-explanatory, given that [spoiler]there\\'ll be another chapter[/spoiler], but everything I saw for me was enough to come to my own conclusions.\\n\\nWhile I\\'m praising this game for how well they manage to narrate things, I can\\'t say I\\'m not a little [i]saturated[/i] from these cyberpunk games. \\n\\nI mean, not that I don\\'t like what I see. It\\'s just that sometimes, these type of games with this settings and environments tend to get a little [b]repetitive[/b]. I don\\'t mean that in a bad way, but there are always pretty much the same ideas when it comes to cyberpunk: evil corp, cyber stuff, redemption, war and all of that. I think that Katana Zero sometimes struggles to feel original and fresh, while still staying really solid in terms of animations and structure. \\n\\nCombine that with the \"Hotline Miami\" level style and the OSTs, which remind me too much of compositions from the latter, and you\\'ve got yourself a really good game with really good ideas always getting to the same conclusions as other games.\\n\\nTake [b]Red Strings Club[/b], for example. There are always those aspects, but the gameplay feels different and unique, while telling a cyberpunk story (which can be summed up as evil corp etc). \\n\\nI didn\\'t mean to rant on this, but [i]you get the point[/i]. There are strong elements here that stand out, though. For example, dialogues are highlighted in a way that makes its characters feel alive and real. I could understand what they were saying really well; I did relate with them and their feelings. So there\\'s that.\\n\\n[h3]Then... what to do?[/h3]\\nI [b]recommend[/b] this for sure: it\\'s a well made game and it has entertained me, and I think it\\'ll entertain you too. It\\'s just that, sometimes, I wish something more interesting story-wise and not so much focus on the cyberpunk aesthetic, which should only be a setting, not the main protagonist.\\n\\nMore reviews:\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/bodolovsello/recommended/'},\n",

It's only like 5 hours long (though you can extend that with speedrunning and hard mode of course), but it's breathlessly efficient with how it uses its time.

BUT take your time in making it so it releases as well made as this.\\n\\nStory:\\nI won\\'t real anything but the story will reveal itself slowly over the 11 chapters and is a big part of the game to the point that if you only play games for the gameplay there is a chance you might not like the game too much I believe also to add to that, Katana Zero has 2 endings. Anyhow the game is rather short and as such the story isn\\'t finish yet so everyone that finishes it is still waiting for the Part 2. The game takes place in a mix of cyberpunk with some sprinkles of dystopian city and the character you play is a veteran that fights mercilessly. I\\'m not really telling you much of anything related to the story here but it\\'s good trust me... please..\\n\\nGameplay:\\nGameplay is fast and can get rather intense depending on how you play. The gameplay has no RNG element so people who play this game eventually develop quite skillful methods of killing enemies. The game only has 11 levels so it can be finished rather quickly but normally it won\\'t be finished [i]THAT[/i] fast. You only notice how fast you can finish the game when you speedrun it for the first time. The game also has about 4 bosses, 1 \"boss\"(more like a boss room) and 1 hidden boss. The one fault there would be in Katana Zero is that it\\'s not something you want to play with a keyboard if you\\'re going to try and get the speedrun achievement. The moving keys is a tad bit clunky seeing as to drop down a platform you need to press DOWN however pressing DOWN and another key that makes you move LEFT or RIGHT will lead you to rolling instead of just dropping down. While it is possible to get the speedrun achievement with keyboard, I would recommend that you use a controller instead if you don\\'t want to struggle as much. The thing I love the most about the game is how I make progress in an area even if I keep on dying. You won\\'t die the same way each time because each time you\\'ll learn a little bit more (You\\'ll be dodge rolling a lot to get the speedrun achievement btw).\\n\\nArt:\\nThe art is quite amazing for pixel graphics and what I mean isn\\'t that pixel graphics is normally only decent or bad but that the artist really went out of his/her way to get in a lot of detail in everything. It makes me wish I was good enough to create something like that. Pixel graphics should always have a place in the game industry and Katana Zero shows why.\\n\\nMusic:\\nMusic is aaaaamaaazzziiinnnggggggg and each area has it\\'s own song including that bosses have their own as well. I went into the game like any other expecting to like 1 or 2 songs but I ended up loving most of the songs in the game, even the  hardbass ones I\\'m normally not a fan off.\\n\\nOverall:\\nAn honestly top-notch game that\\'s completely worth getting, it does have it shares of faults control wise but the good outweigh the bad to an extreme amount in this game however I still have to warn everyone that if you want to play Katana Zero, you don\\'t want to just play it for the gameplay, you have to be someone that also enjoy the story side of the game and well... use a controller if you don\\'t want to suffer as much in speedrunning. Tip on hardcore mode and maybe also on speedrunning (is a slight spoiler) [spoiler] I recommend using the Sword of Masters because it basically has an infinite amount of projectiles you can shoot with only a short CD you need to wait for.[/spoiler]\\n\\nWelp you got this far in my first review so the curse is on you now. You\\'ll have a good day now even if you don\\'t want to.\\n'},\n",

The Story/plot is so intriguing and maybe a plot twist spiced in there..... but i rate it a 9/10 maybe even a 10/10 to be honest must need another adaptation to this series in particular.

       "  'Review Content': 'Holy shit, what a great game!\\n\\u2028\\u2028Katana Zero is amazing in all aspects: gameplay, story, art, replayability, and soundtrack. And to keep this review short, I’ll summarize what all those elements make the game incredible, unique, and something that stands out from all other indie games.\\u2028\\u2028\\n\\nTHE GAMEPLAY:\\u2028\\u2028\\n\\nThe gameplay is very simple: One slash of your sword kills your enemy, and one bullet kills you instantly. This mechanic is enough to make the game not entirely hard, but rather challenging. The idea is to always keep your eyes open, slashing your enemies one at a time. If you’re not too confident about your reflexes, that’s not a problem, because the game also has a slow-mo feature! It’s extremely useful to deflect bullets and gives you enough time to make you plan your moves!\\u2028\\u2028\\n\\nTHE STORY (SPOILERS-FREE):\\n\\n\\u2028\\u2028The story takes place in the Third District of New Mecca, where the main character, Zero, resides. Zero is a professional assassin who looks for answers about his past, while receiving some sort of treatment from his psychiatrist. As the story progresses, a few questions are answered, and more questions keep showing up on the player’s mind, trying to tie each and every element of the story together. By the time I’m writing this review, there’s already a free DLC around the corner to cover probably all the questions a player can have while playing Katana Zero.\\u2028\\u2028\\n\\nTHE ART:\\u2028\\u2028\\n\\nIt doesn’t matter if you’re not a big fan of pixelated games or not, you have to believe me when I say the art of Katana Zero is impressive. The game is very colourful, and each level has so many details, it’s honestly jaw-dropping! The lighting effects are also super awesome to notice.\\u2028\\u2028\\n\\nREPLAYABILITY:\\n\\n\\u2028\\u2028I have to be honest: by the time I’m writing this, I have 21.3 hours in this game, and that’s not only because I’ve played the story mode several times. Once you complete the game, you’ll unlock the speedrun mode, which is the main reason I’ve spent so much time in this game. If you’re an aspiring speed runner like me, I strongly recommend you to enjoy the experience of the game first, and then challenge yourself by getting platinum medal on the speedrun mode!\\n\\nSOUNDTRACK:\\n\\nIt only takes two EDM artists to make Katana Zero so stylish: LudoWic and Bill Kiley. Without any personal exception, all songs are awesome and perfectly fits the atmosphere of each scene in the game.\\u2028\\u2028\\n\\nCONCLUSION:\\n\\n\\u2028\\u2028Katana Zero may be a short game. Seriously, you can actually beat it in one hour. But everything that’s been mentioned here is a summary of all I actually wanted to talk about this game, and by personal experience, this game is one of my favourite indie games ever. If you’re a player who’s looking for good gameplay, with some varieties, Katana Zero is for you. If you’re a player who appreciates a good story, Katana Zero is for you, if you’re a player who loves pixel art… well, you get the idea.\\n\\n\\u2028\\u2028\\u2028I give this game a 4.7 out of 5 rating. Once I get to play the Free DLC, I’ll give it a 5 out 5 rating.\\u2028\\u2028\\n\\nSee you in a next review!'},\n",

Use your incredibly sharp blade, stealth, insane reflexes and time manipulation to slaughter your targets and all who stand before you.\\n\\nYour enemies will die in a single hit, that hit feels nice and weighty, and they go down with a glorious spray of blood as the impact sends them flying across the room, which all makes taking them down feel wonderful. But you also go down in one hit, so you better watch out! Dying in a section means you have to repeat it entirely, but they're each pretty short (even the longest can be completed in a few minutes I think), so it generally feels manageable, even for those sections with parts you just can't get right. Regular gameplay is a frantic loop of making your way through a stage, as you take care not to get hit, dispose of your enemies quickly, mess up that one part ever so slightly, then die, restart and do it all again until you get it right, and it is wonderful. You also have the ability to slow down time to make trickier maneuvers easier to pull off.\\n\\nThe art is nice, it's pixel-y with a lot of interesting effects thrown in, and has something of a retro cyberpunk aesthetic to it. The music does a great job of setting the mood for your killing sprees. The story is also really interesting, far above what I would have expected, and is certain to impress you, horrify you, leave you asking questions, and also sadly leave you feeling unfulfilled in some respects, as some threads aren't fully explored by the game's end.\\n\\nIt's an amazing game overall, would highly recommend it to anyone fond of 2D action games.\"},\n",

And much like the real world Mecca I want to pilgrimage to the creators of this game and pray to their stones for giving me such an incredible time - KZ leaves an impression that every game should aspire to. \\n\\nIt is, firstly, imperative that you play this game with a pair of headsets with great bass because the music in this game is the BOMB. Possibly the best use of electronica in a video game that I have personally experienced till date. Love it Love it Love it.\\n\\nWhat complements the rhythm is the inventive action in this game in form of platforming levels encasing set piece enemies - you basically bring a sword to a gun fight and its fun AF. The depiction of action with its bullet time, pace and blood splatter is a work of art and there is real heart put into creating the environments. The pixel art of this game itself is a great sell - loved the disco level especially btw.\\n\\nThe story too is intriguing enough for you to keep powering through the fun and punishing orgy of sword and bullets as you play the role of a contracted special ops (kinda) soldier working for a powerful organization (government?) carrying out hit-jobs. As you do so, the story drip feeds you with meaty plot development and you discover more about your grim past and your present association with the drug Chronos. Oh and there is also a sweet 5 year old girl that befriends you.\\n\\nCertain set piece battles are more tough than others but there is adequate challenge to be had in the game. With the music and artwork put together into the action, I'd highlight that there is a flow to this game that really makes this an amazingly enjoyable experience. There really needs to be many more games like this.\\n\\nPlay this game today, don't wait for the sale. You want this. You need this. It's a damn near perfect video game.\\n\\n9/10\"},\n",

Number 1, the story left A LOT of unanswered questions. I won\\'t list any here but it made me guessing for more and because the story was so intriguing and so interesting that it just left me wanting more, so maybe it was that. Number 2, the occasional bug that was a make or break in some levels. Don\\'t get me wrong the game is incredibly polished but in my entirety of playing the game I experienced around 8 game breaking bugs that made me feel horrible. To name a few, I clipped through the ceiling and had to restart the level when only one enemy remained. I heard the \"bullet reflect clank\" noise but the bullet didn\\'t reflect and I ended up getting shot. And lastly, the game not deciding when I can and can\\'t roll.

This game is nothing but the finest combination of artful story-telling, great stylish graphics, fast-paced fair action and just seriously one of the best games to sink your teeth into over the weekend. The only complaint I'd have is that the story is left a bit open (with free DLC coming soon which will hopefully wrap it up), but don't let that detract you from purchasing this experience and robbing yourself from the chance to finally feel like John Wick - if only he was wielding a sword instead of a gun.\\n\\nAt first I had some reservations about the overall playtime with story being only about 4 hours long, but after realising that hard mode is not just the same levels with inflated hit points I've found another 4 hours of enjoyment from that part as well. While hard mode is satisfying by itself, the best feeling is coming back to the normal game and feeling like a proper Katana-wielding god of death slashing fools like there is no tomorrow, the game presents yet another challenge to you via the form of a speed run. I've always found speedrunning interesting, but never really had the time or dedication needed to truly devote myself to a particular game, but Katana Zero has successfully lulled me into completing the Gold Medal achievement which requires you to beat the game under 30 minutes. After some Googling and about 6 more hours, I've managed to do it - all thanks to the masterful difficulty progression that was so meticulously put together by the developers.\\n\\nTruly, if you have any love for action platformers and want an experience that keeps offering more in new and inventive ways, look no further. This is a diffcult, yet rewarding, game, which definitely gives back all that the player is willing to invest. It is easily one of the top games to have come out this year and I can't keep my mittens to myself asking for more!\\n\\n10/10 proper masterpiece\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': 'Holy sh*t dude, Katana ZERO. I was half-expecting the game to be yet another overhyped indie that I wouldn\\'t really jive with, but this game honestly gets the praise it deserves. \\n\\nOne would be quick to compare the game to Hotline Miami, but I think Katana ZERO is far more visceral and aggressive than Hotline. The defensive options that the player has can be used to further augment an aggressive push-oriented playstyle. The dodge roll can not only be used to dodge bullets, but it can be used to move closer to the enemy or just to reduce the delay between slashes. Not to mention you can reflect bullets with a well timed slice. It just feels so right when you get a good spree going. Even though there is some items you can toss, combat is most often up close and personal.\\n\\nThe game is fairly difficult at times, since you can die just as easily as you can kill. The game gives you the ability to slow down time to try and think more about your next move, but I find myself using it as a panic button more often than not. Since the game is a bit strict on getting good timing down, having the ability to slow the pace to the player\\'s will can help out, but I think I would have preferred something a little different. There was a different indie game I played years ago called Gunpoint that had this feature where if you died, you had the option to rewind 1 to 5 seconds before you died, so you can instantly try to redo the dumb thing you did in hopes that it would work if you did it better. I would\\'ve liked a feature like that in Katana ZERO, since dying means you have to restart a part in the level, and some parts in some levels take a really long time to do. You could argue that this reduces the consequences and tension to dying, but I\\'d argue that having this feature would keep the momentum of aggression flowing by being able to instantly try again the moment you screw up. Mistakes could still be punished if you, say, limit the amount of times you can go back a few seconds before restarting.\\n\\nThe stealth sections in this game, as cool as they are on paper, don\\'t really fit with the design of the game. I suppose they do fit with the thematics and story, but they slow the pace of the game down to a literal crawl. Even though they are optional, I had the impression that you had to stealth in order to get better results. I think the main problem with the stealth is that it would work in a game where you\\'re more vulnerable, and you\\'re not some killing machine. The moments the game tells you specifically not to kill bad guys kinda frustrates me with my compliance, all because I\\'m lead to believe that I might have to just sneak on by.\\n\\nThe story of the game is surprisingly compelling for a game all about assassinating targets. There\\'s slow moments where you\\'re just lounging around your place, drinking herbal tea and watching the latest news of some supposed \"Dragon\". Then you\\'re talking to your psychiatrist who prescribes you with time drugs. The dialogue and the world feels real for its setting, and the writing is evidently on point. Granted, you wouldn\\'t play a game like this just for its story, but it is cool to have that. It makes the game more memorable overall.\\n\\nThe soundtrack, and to an extension, the aesthetics of the game follow the trend of returning to the roots of the 80s. You got the VHS style rewinding and those classic synths. For me, that sort of thing is starting to wain on me due to overexposure, but I can still admire it for what it is. I especially love the settings screen that\\'s just blue and while like back then. You even continue where you left off by loading VHS tapes into a TV. Having said all that, the soundtrack just feels serviceable at the least. I\\'ve never felt like at one point that the OSTs really added to the experience, but maybe I\\'m just biased and would really love to kill to some Carpenter Brut blasting loudly. I think where the soundtrack is best is for those chill moments when you\\'re not killing. They really make you feel all cozy inside. I can say the same for the game\\'s entire sprite work and sound design. Everything feels like it has terrific impact and weight to it; everything just fits perfectly.\\n\\nAt the time of writing this, I haven\\'t beaten the game yet, but I feel like I\\'m already half-way through it. For the experiences I\\'ve had with the game though, it is well worth the price. I\\'ve been coming home from work at my crummy job always thinking \"I can\\'t wait to get back and play Katana ZERO\" and these days I\\'ve hardly had that feeling. I\\'ve never played a game this damn good in a long time, and with recent updates involving hard mode and speedrunning, I am ever so eager to see what lies in store for the rest of the game, and whatever it might offer in the future.\\n\\nEDIT: I beat Katana ZERO twice and I am confident to say that I have seen all there is to the game in its current state. This game is probably the best game I have had the chance to play this summer. I\\'d also like to mention that the soundtrack has grown on me a bit.'},\n",

Great game, but I\\'d advise waiting for the story to finish; that, or pick it up on a good sale. \\n\\nIt should have been titled Katana ZERO: Part I or released in Early Access, but I\\'m rather satisfied with what I got for now. Be prepared for lots of Hotline Miami comparisons, because I\\'m going all in on those comparisons. The gameplay was fun, almost like a side-scrolling Hotline Miami. Insanely fast, one hit one kill gameplay where you frantically scramble to move as you\\'ve just messed up your original plan. Brutal, fluid and especially satisfying when you pull it off.\\n\\nRemember how Hotline Miami was broken into several parts? Katana ZERO was definitely made of parts but they only included part one. Like Hotline Miami, the story is mysterious, brutal and oozing in outrun style that leaves you constantly wondering just what is real and what isn\\'t. Dialogue is witty and impactful, with a great way for the player to interrupt the flow in a natural way.

I feel if you know that it\\'s incomplete, and are willing to wait for the [free!] story DLC to be added soon, then go ahead.

So far I'm loving the pixel art and the cyberpunk/neo-noir settings, the stellar soundtrack and platforming. It delivers what I expected from it, a tight title oozing with confidence in its style and design. Not to mention that the story goes really deep and dark,  taking inspiration from the Vietnam War for it's setting.\"},\n",

You can slow down time, dodge and parry bullets back at enemies, that never gets old. You also die a lot as the one hit kill works on you and lucky the game restart is fast and won’t annoy you.\\n\\n    [*]The game’s story and interaction with it is what sets it apart and sets it apart from being just an average game, so if you don’t like it the game won’t be as good to you. All I can say is it’s weird but understandable unlike Hotline Miami and other more cryptic games. It deals with drugs, memory loss, time travel, war crimes, and more in a story that doesn’t feel over complicated or hard to follow despite having so much going on.\\n\\n    [*]The only bad thing about this game is it ends on cliffhanger because apparently the game isn’t complete yet, but the ending is like act 1 ending and does feel like a good point to end, so it’s not a terrible, but you do want to see where it goes, so many answers left and the other half will be added later, so you can actually wait till then, but I don’t want to give this negative review.

       "  'Review Content': \"Framing is an oft-overlooked element of game design. Sure, you can slap bullet time or save points into your game without explanation, but making them part of the narrative can provide unparalleled immersion for even the most outlandish titles. That’s what makes games like Katana ZERO such rare joys, the fact that every single element of the presentation is tied to the narrative and mechanics. From your time-bending powers all the way to the VCR you select stages on, this intense, bloody journey builds layers of meaning and intrigue around a single, compelling core: getting through this neo-noir hell with as much style as possible.\\n\\nIn the rain-slicked streets of a grim neon city you arrive, clad in but a bathrobe and armed with only cold Japanese steel. The voice on the other end of your phone wants you to kill everyone in the strange factory you find yourself at, a simple task once you start slowing down time to the point where you can deflect bullets with a sword. Room by room you expunge all life almost effortlessly, painting the walls with blood from an impossibly quick blade. When your task is done you return to your hovel of an apartment, your nightmares, your appointment with that voice on the phone, your neighbors, your demons, your rivals, your doubts, your fears, and the truth.\\n\\nTo say anything more would be to spoil one of the most intense and twisting narratives you’re ever going to get from a platformer, one that I’m going to be mulling over for days if not weeks. Your hobo samurai has a lot of people interested in his mysterious combat prowess, while at the same time you get to play through vignettes of his life as an attempted citizen. There’s often more drama in these little glimpses of city life than in the machinations of war and government he’s caught in, thanks to some excellent writing and world-building. Just the way factions from the war are mentioned, or districts of the city, or famous figures is enough to make the setting pop in a way that few games can.\\n\\nMore than this, though, is how the brilliant dialog system puts you right in the center of the story. It’s one of those where your responses are on a timer, and you must make your dialog choice before time runs out. However, most choices also give you a tiny window at the start where you can interrupt the person speaking. Interruptions can lead to wildly different paths through the dialog, and sometimes affect gameplay beyond that. And it’s all done in lavishly colored animated text that floats over the speakers, highlighting key terms for emphasis and shattering on interruptions. Just when you think you’ve seen everything Katana ZERO does with this mechanic, I assure you it will find a way to surprise you.\\n\\nThat’s really the beauty of this one across all its features, that it will never stop surprising you. Every mechanic and detail will eventually get used in a way you didn’t see coming, and that happens most frequently in the action itself. As a godlike samurai assassin, you have only your sword and your reflexes to dispatch goons, swordsmen, armed security, and worse. But you can slow down time to perfect your moves, roll past deadly attacks, reflect bullets with your blade, and sling objects like bottles and vases to neutralize distant threats. Each room must be perfected before you can move on, like little bite-sized Hotline Miami levels strung together in a mounting crescendo of murder.\\n\\nBut here again, Katana ZERO excels in the details. The action you are partaking in, the ritual of attempting, dying, and attempting again, is framed as the planning that your bathrobed terror does before actually executing. Once you have perfected your plan, the game replays the room for you as if on a security tape so you can witness your exploits at human speed. This is a key framing mechanic, and one that the plot centers on in a big way. And even this will defy your expectations in incredible ways, ways that make the game all the more engrossing as you battle your way through it.\\n\\nI cannot stress enough how polished every aspect of this title is, either. The pixel art is absolutely lush in its animations and special effects, making you feel ever strike of the blade and hitch of the video tape playback. The sound design matches the intensity of the action, and the soundtrack is some absolutely killer synthwave and soulful tracks that carry the neo-noir stylings to new heights. There are moments of levity, like the cosplay dialog options and Strong Terry, and moments of intense dread. There are beautiful vistas, and rooms caked in gore. It’s an incredible ride from start to finish, and I assure you that you’ll be left wanting more at the end of your 4-hour (or so) journey. Katana ZERO has a vision and it stops at nothing to express it, blending style, substance, and action into one of the most cohesive packages I’ve ever seen.\\n\\n\\n\\nDid you enjoy this review? I certainly hope so, and I certainly hope you'll check out more of them at https://goldplatedgames.com/ or on my [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/11322459/]curation page[/url]!\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"I'm on a quest to find out whether this game is better than sex.\\n\\nEDIT: Had sex, the game is better.\\n\\nEDIT 2: So here's the actual review. I won't focus on reviewing just the game, but rather focus on the area that does not get talked about enough, which is speedrunning the game (the reason why I have half a thousand hours in the game). The game is exceptionally good at speedrunning, it's both easy to pick up and extremely satisfying to continue striving for even better times. Why ? It's because the gameplay is both satisfying and hard, and it only gets more punishing as you incorporate even more challenging ways of completing each room. A few more reasons why it's great to speedrun:\\n- Barely any RNG present when speedrunning (besides the motorcycle section, but the dev promised that he will make this section RNG-less once the DLC comes out) and the RNG that is present only accounts for a few seconds of time variation, so that basically only matters at top level. As such the player's skill is the only thing that matters if you beat your personal best time or not.\\n- The run itself is mostly gameplay, there are no cutscenes that you have to sit through and waste your time (there are like 3 instances total of the player needing to wait ~10 seconds in the entirety of the run).\\n- Most rooms are challenging to speedrun, and each one have ways of improving time. There aren't many situations where once you learn the particular room it stops being challenging or it's impossible to shave off further time (exception being the final boss and autoscroller in doom, but a doom skip has been found for one of the autoscroller parts, so that's epic)\\n- The runs are short, at top level they only take 15 minutes to complete, this means that you do not have to focus for extended periods of time.\\n- The game is very easy to setup for speedrunning, you don't need to setup an external program to keep track of time, since there is an in-game timer.\\n- The dev actually listens to our requests and will change some stuff once the DLC comes out.\\n- The speedrunning scene is active, so pop into the speedrunning discord server and ask your questions.\\nSo if you're interested in speedrunning the game, check out the guides section of the game's speedrun.com page. If you have never speedran a game before, give it a try, this was my first game that I speedran and it's a blast, give yourself a challenge first of obtaining a gold medal (~30 min range speedrun), and if you found it to be fun, aim for a sub-20 min run next.\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': '[b]Katana ZERO[/b] is a highly immersive cyberpunk/neo-noir (I honestly don’t know the difference) cross between Ninja Gaiden and Hotline Miami. Albeit incomplete and short, this game oozes high quality production from start to finish; my only hope is that the continuation/future updates will manage to maintain this level of quality. I also want to mention that this genre of games usually doesn’t interest me, so this experience was a very pleasant surprise. \\nA big thank you to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/dworry]dworry[/url] for recommending this game! \\n\\n[u][b]Played with PlayStation 4 controller[/b][/u]\\n\\n[h1]✔️[u]Positive:[/u][/h1]\\n[b][+] Attention to detail in combination with creative and intelligent design choices makes Katana ZERO an incredibly immersive experience:[/b]\\n[olist]\\n[*][b]We need to talk about how extraordinary the dialogue is.[/b]\\nYes, the writing is good, but the way that dialogue was presented is what really blew me away. The developers used a myriad of animations to incorporate “voice acting” in the text boxes without the use of voices at all. By changing things such as the speed of text appearing, and animations and colour of certain words or phrases, you get a very strong indication of the tone of dialogue. \\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2163734569 \\nFurthermore, you are offered dynamic dialogue options that change during the countdown. You can choose to take your time to select your most appropriate answer, or quickly and rudely interrupt whoever is speaking (emphasized by the shattering of the text box). Naturally, your answers/actions have an impact on the direct conversation and the course of the story. Katana ZERO may not be the first to incorporate these designs but they managed to execute it masterfully. \\n\\n[*][b]Superb attention to detail.[/b] \\nThere are multiple examples of this but I will focus on the details that I found really added to the immersion:\\n\\n(a) Random entertaining NPC encounters that juxtapose the gore and other mature themes that run rampant throughout the game. [i]You can also pet a cat.[/i]\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2163733927\\n\\n(b) Mundane actions such as burning your kill contract or drinking your tea at the end of a mission have to be triggered by the player. It may seem silly but the simple act of interacting with a tea cup actually transmitted through the screen and helped me relax after the high-intensity segments. \\n\\n(c) At the start of the action sequences, Zero (main character) takes a moment to put on earphones and turn on his music cassette, which in turn cues the in-game music. As an added bonus, the music is [u]amazing[/u]. \\n[/olist]\\n\\n[b][+] Easy to learn, hard to master type gameplay with the right amount of difficulty.[/b]\\nIn short, you can move like a ninja and are equipped with the ability to slow down time, dodge roll, slash your sword and throw certain objects. The time-manipulation is certainly overpowered but is not indefinite (used up like stamina) and is counterbalanced by the fact that Zero has no health bar; every mistake is fatal and will cause you to reset the room. Each level requires a balance between good reflexes, wit, tactics and adaptability. Optional unlockable swords aside, you do not obtain any new abilities during the game but instead get better at managing your time-manipulation ability to deal with increasingly complex situations. While this is usually not my preferred type of game, the progressive difficulty made for a very enjoyable, yet challenging, experience. \\n\\n[h1]➖[u]Neutral:[/u][/h1]\\n[b][-] Compelling but incomplete story.[/b] \\nKatana ZERO does a great job at balancing high intensity encounters with appropriate down-time moments and still manages to organically merge in hints of the backstory. However, the story is currently incomplete and has left me with more questions than answers.\\n\\n[b][-] Given all the buzzing and fizzing effects, this game is indubitably the worst nightmare for people with photosensitive epilepsy.[/b] \\nIt’s clear that the developers are aware of this, since they included a warning directly upon launching the game and also the option to turn it off. Since I do not suffer from epilepsy, I chose to experience the game as intended by the developers but found that it was a little too buzz-y and fizz-y for my taste.\\n\\n[b][-] Each room has a countdown timer to encourage a high pace but there were very few instances where I felt pressured to finish the level.[/b] \\nPerhaps the developers were too generous with the time given? This may not be the case for hard mode but I don’t know from personal experience.\\n\\n[h1]❌[u]Negative:[/u][/h1]\\n[b][x] Short.[/b] \\nMy first blind playthrough took approximately ~3 hours, and then an additional ~2.5 hours to explore alternative paths and endings. Upon finishing the game, hard and speed run modes are made available but I am more interested in experiencing the rest of the story. As far as I know, the developers have promised more content, so (hopefully) there will be more to look forward to!\\n \\n[h1]🏅[u]Verdict:[/u][/h1]\\n[h1]★★★★☆ A fantastic start[/h1]\\nKatana ZERO is currently an incomplete experience but shows a lot of potential. Despite thoroughly enjoying the game in its current state, I am slightly hesitant to recommend it at this moment. However, at the same time, the game shows enough promise to justify my faith that the rest of the game will be just as good (or even better?). The satisfying gameplay and immersive story form an excellent base to what might be an exceptional gaming experience. Let’s hope for the best!\\n\\n[table]\\n[tr][th][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/26827738/]If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up and follow me on my [b]curator page[/b].[/url]\\n🇹🇭🇦🇳🇰 🇾🇴🇺 🇫🇴🇷 🇾🇴🇺🇷 🇸🇺🇵🇵🇴🇷🇹!\\n[/th][/tr]\\n[/table]'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"Where do I begin? This cult classic has slowly become my favourite game of all time. The side-scrolling slasher has been reinvented as an amalgamation of Hotline Miami and Classic Ninja Gaiden.  \\nTelling compelling narratives in video games is no easy feat. Taking a heavily story-focused approach to design typically either results in more of an interactive movie or, in trying to balance both, nails storytelling at the expense of a top-quality gameplay experience. Every now and then, though, a game manages to nail the formula in a way that never feels intrusive or unnecessary. Katana ZERO is one of those games.\\n\\nKatana ZERO is incredibly secretive with its premise, and for good reason. The player takes on the role of a young man who’s seemingly an assassin for hire. He takes assignments during the day and returns to his rundown apartment building in a less than desirable part of town at night. Every day he visits his psychiatrist to talk through his experiences and get a dose of a mysterious drug that allows him to manipulate time (something that has pivotal story and combat implications). The prologue is simple and gets you familiar with the combat system. It starts off as your formuala one hit kill which makes you want to play smart. It quite steadily evolves into more with the addition of the Chronos mechanic. Though it starts out fairly straightforward, the story takes several turns quickly. The writing here is sharp, and the narrative runs the gauntlet of emotions from thrilling to comforting to horrifying all in the game’s short five to seven-hour runtime. I dare not spoil even a bit of the deeper narrative here, but Katana ZERO’s unique dialogue system forces players to make quick decisions that directly impact how the game plays out, making it worth playing through multiple times in to try other routes. The story takes many incredible turns which will certainly confuse you (so try and pay close attention to all the dialogue.) There's very subtle but satisfying instances of foreshadowing to spot which only adds to this game's amazing replayability. With a recent update, speedrun and hard-mode have been added to compensate with the lack of content which offers a lot more to challenge yourself. \\n\\nQuite on the other end of the scale is the absolutely stellar sound design and 80s synth-pop soundtrack. The ringing sound in your ears every time you get a new dose of “medicine” never stops feeling unnerving, and even the measured use of silence is done to great effect. There’s a great mix of energetic and sombre tracks, and I came to grow rather fond of the quaint piano keys that played during the more mellow scenes. Also worth noting is that the names of songs and composers appear at the start of each mission shown on-screen as the samurai switches the track on his walkman.\\n\\nKatana ZERO is a concise, mysterious and rather sombre game. The way it tells its intimate story is engaging as some of the best thrillers out there, though whether or not the story itself lives up to the delivery is debatable. Nonetheless, this is an action game first and foremost, and to that end, it passes with flying colours. Expect to die and get frustrated a lot, but also look forward to a deep sense of satisfaction after banging your head against a particularly tough boss or enemy sequence. There’s a lot of fun to have here and, with the choices you make having a significant impact on how the narrative plays out, it pays to run through the game a second time and try other options.\\n\\nIf gameplay, audio, visuals, and story were ammo loaded into a gun, Katana ZERO is firing consecutively from each barrel. With every component supporting each other, the title feels very consistent and well rounded. Any flaws like difficulty or varying times of knockdown recovery can be overlooked in my opinion. \\n\\nMasterpiece, 10/10\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': '[h1] Katana Zero is a game about a former war veteran, who works now as an assignment killer, wearing katana and samurai outfit. The whole game is presented as a neo-noir full of neon decorations action platformer with a captivating story full of twists and turnabouts. [/h1]  \\n\\n[b] Pros: [/b]\\n\\n+ Satisfying gameplay with fast combat and lots of planning\\n+ A captivating story that is easy to follow\\n+ Protagonists\\' unique abilities \\n+ Perfect level design\\n+ Outstanding pixel art\\n+ Synthwave/retrowave soundtrack \\n\\n[b] Cons: [/b]\\n\\n- The game is exactly filled with redundant swearings and dirty talks\\n- The whole game is frustratingly short \\n\\nJust imagine that you found a game, which is a perfect mix of one your favorite genres in gaming, it\\'s filled with your type of music and its plot reminds you of all these mindblowing movies you were crazy about all the time. That\\'s exactly what happened to me while I was playing Katana Zero.\\n\\nKatana Zero combines everything that you need to have in a game, that would be called \"a true masterpiece\" when it\\' released. It\\'s like picking perfect ingredients to make a delicious meal. But what\\'s more important is that aftertaste that you feel after the meal. \\n\\nThat\\'s what Katana Zero manages to do in the best way.\\n\\n[h1] Story [/h1]\\n\\nThe story is probably the strongest part of the game and it\\'s something I don\\'t want to talk much about, simply because it\\'s so unique and mindblowing, that you have to experience it all for yourself without any spoilers. The whole story had been strongly influenced by the best representatives of the cyberpunk genre and I am pretty much sure, that every single player will see this story in their own way.\\n\\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\\n\\nThe whole game is represented as a typical \"one shot-one kill\" game. You play as a veteran of a war, dressed in a kimono, a samurai which name, the whole story, and identity remain as a secret until the end of the game. The game\\'s mechanics follow pretty much the same idea: you come to the therapist/psychologist, he asks you a few questions about your health, gives you a mysterious drug and sends you on the next mission. After your mission is done, you come back to your apartment, watch a vivid dream and then repeat. \\n\\nOne of the first game mechanics you meet in the game is the dialog options system. The player always a choice either interrupt interlocutor with a nervous response or listen to the end to have more answer options. Usually, this interruption thing leads to unpleasant consequences, while if you remain patient, you have a chance to retrieve some new information regarding the story and the game\\'s protagonist. \\n\\nWhen it comes to combat, the protagonist has the ability to plan his attacks and rewind time whenever he fails. Once you proceed with the story, the game explains everything regarding this ability and how it all works. Since it\\'s a one shot-one kill prepare to die a lot and plan as much as possible during your game. The difficulty\\'s curve of this game can be a little bit weird: you start the game and it looks pretty easy, then few levels later it becomes way more difficult, then it becomes easy again and then everything changes once again. \\n\\nIt’s important to mention that the whole combat thing is pretty fast, the player can dash, reflect enemies’ bullets, roll between the enemies, make jump walls to get to his destination point, etc. This fast-paced action always keeps you strained never giving a little chance to relax. Most of the enemies can be killed by a single hit, some of the enemies can deflect at least one hit, so they require two hits to be killed but the most annoying enemies are the ones with shields, because they force you to jump over them and outsmart them, which can be a difficult task sometimes. \\n\\nThe majority of side scrolled levels can be completed pretty quickly and easily without any attempts or retries. Every single level is divided into small stages and if the players get a bullet in his head, they have to start over from that particular stage, not the whole level. What I really enjoyed in Katana ZERO is that most of the levels can be completed in multiple ways and the player always has a choice. It can be very helpful and quite convenient if the player is stuck at a certain point and the best way is to try something else.\\n\\nAll my love goes to developers for making the game equally interesting in terms of gameplay and its story. The more you play, the more you get into the story and feel like you don’t want this game to end. They were able to find a perfect balance between the gameplay mechanics, level design, some unique levels that are different from the regular one, where you have to kill everyone and then just run away, pretty interesting and remarkable boss battles, etc. At some point, you understand that you feel a weird satisfaction dashing through enemies and quickly roaming around the levels to fulfill your contract.\\n\\nWhat I really didn’t appreciate about this game is an incredible amount of swearings and bad words all along. I never felt like it was something required for the whole game or the story itself, this game would be even better without it in my opinion, seriously it was way too much at some point. \\n\\n[h1] Graphics [/h1]\\n\\nKatana ZERO has pixel art graphics that may look pretty simple from the first glance, but once you play the game for some time, you will see that every single level, enemy and every other thing in the game is quite detailed despite its simplified style. Plus all these visual tricks with neon lights, VHS old tapes, and CCTV recording screens add some amazing charm to this game as well.\\n\\n[h1] Sound [/h1]\\n\\nAs being a huge fan of retrowave/synthwave music myself, I instantly fell in love with Katana ZERO soundtrack. The whole game is filled with Ludowic and Bill Kiley’s tracks which perfectly suit the atmosphere of the game. \\n\\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\\n\\nKatana ZERO is a great pick for someone who is in love with action fast-paced challenging games and once you are into it, you will enjoy the game to the very end. It can be a bit annoying from time to time with its frustrating levels and a ridiculous amount of enemies, but it doesn’t change the fact that you are dealing with a great and quality indie title.\\n\\n[h1] Enjoy!

       "  'Review Content': 'From the outset, Katana ZERO wears its inspirations on its sleeve. Its pulsating neon aesthetic, synth-heavy soundtrack, and hyper-violent gameplay are all familiar trappings of countless flashy titles populating the indie games space. Most are lackluster attempts to recreate the magic of 2012’s Hotline Miami, failing to build upon the groundwork laid by one of the most successful aesthetically similar titles. Katana ZERO’s dedication to presenting highly stylized and polished gameplay topped with a thought-provoking psychological storyline is what makes it a standout title of 2019.\\n\\n Katana ZERO is a neo-noir action adventure title that puts you in the robes of a mysterious samurai hitman. Tasked with eliminating targets residing within the confines of the dilapidated metropolis by a mysterious employer, the player searches for targets as well as answers to their equally mysterious past.\\n\\nKatana ZERO’s gameplay concept is fairly straightforward, however the level of mechanical polish and style makes it remarkable. Levels, such as prisons and underground science facilities, are broken down into various rooms. Each room is filled with patrolling enemies that must be eliminated before being allowed to proceed. Combat is instant death, which adds considerable weight upon every action taken. Careful planning is required before proceeding, which places even greater emphasis on a required gameplay mechanic: death. Death triggers the rewind feature which, upon dying, shows the player a replay of their last life. This feature allows for analysis of mistakes or an opportunity to study environments to discover alternate routes or strategies to employ. In a game where death comes in a split second, this tool is imperative to mastering the fundamentals of combat.\\n\\nWhile death is frequent, most encounters (boss battles aside) should only require a handful of lives before being able to surpass them. Combat is challenging due to its ever-evolving nature which forces the player to be dynamic in their problem-solving. Fortunately, the player is given the freedom to pursue creative solutions to combat, as they are never pigeonholed in a single solution. While brute forcing their way through fights is rarely viable, it always remains an option if your skills are up to the task.\\n\\nAs you are a samurai, a katana is the primary means of dispatching enemies, but you also momentarily have the handy ability to slow down time. This makes evading enemy attacks simpler and ideal for perfectly deflecting incoming projectiles back at their senders. The feeling of lethal speed of your character is both satisfying and gives combat a fluency that’s intoxicating. There are also single use projectiles such as bottles, knives, and Molotov cocktails scattered throughout environments that serve as deadly commodities best reserved for tricky combat situations. All of these abilities are essential in exploiting the weaknesses of more advanced enemies, such as shield-wielding cops or katana-parrying thugs.\\n\\nHad Katana ZERO merely been a fantastic stealth action game devoid of a meaningful story, it would still be an easy recommendation. So it also offering an expertly penned psychological neo-noir story not only elevates but compliments the entire experience. The player’s plight to uncover their traumatic past is one that begins simply enough yet quickly presents many more intriguing questions. Snippets of backstory are uncovered during therapy sessions or visits to your dilapidated apartment in-between missions. While at the time these snippets of information may be confusing, all the puzzle pieces fit into place by the end. It isn’t merely rediscovering the past, but interpreting the present. The narrative frequently challenges the player’s understanding of their realities, with the concept of an unreliable narrator being called into question in more ways than one.\\n\\nThe player does have some impact on how their story plays out through the dialogue tree. Frequently faced with dialogue options during conversation, selecting one of three options results in varying conversation paths, and will affect the outcome of some sequences.[spoiler]In one mission, a hotel receptionist questioned my samurai outfit. Instead of ignoring her, I opted to give a lengthy lie about cosplaying as an obscure anime character. At the time, this was a humorous interaction and nothing more. It wasn’t until I was leaving the hotel, covered in my recently slain target’s blood, that a police officer questioned my appearance. Just as I expected a fight to break out, the receptionist interjected explaining that I was a cosplayer and not a crazed killer. The officer bought this and allowed me to leave the lobby peacefully.[/spoiler] Moments like this make the dialogue option more than a simple extension of the narrative, as the player’s decisions can have a meaningful impact on their progression.\\n\\nThrough the entire experience, Katana ZERO exudes a familiar but pleasing aesthetic and noir tone. It’s a gritty, yet illuminated neon city filled with unsavory characters who are a reflection of the run-down metropolis. Its environments are simple in their construction, but the minor details that populate the world give it life. Whether it’s your character switching on their walkman, blasting synth heavy 80s techno before every mission, or removing his katana before sitting down, the developer’s dedication to bringing this world to life is fiercely apparent.\\n\\nMy only complaint is that there isn’t more of it. It only takes about four hours to complete, but I am already planning to return to it to discover alternate dialogue options and to bask in its terrific gameplay. It’s a game that, from the outside, skeptics could dismiss as “just another neon pixelated action game,” which the indie space certainly has an abundance of. But Katana ZERO’s almost unprecedented level of polish, lightning-fast gameplay, and thought-provoking story make it one of the year’s best indie games.'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"[h1]Hotline Miami, Gunpoint and some guy who really likes cyberpunk walk into a bar…[/h1]\\n\\nKatana Zero is a story-driven action platformer developed by Askiisoft. You play as a damaged war hero with a weak grasp on time and reality who performs assassinations for his therapist. It really does feel like a mix between Hotline Miami and Gunpoint: taking the fast pace, high stakes gameplay style from the former, and the level design from the latter. I was really surprised by how much story there is here, I was even more surprised by the fact that it’s actually the most compelling part of the game. \\n\\nNote: At the time of writing this, I have seen one possible ending for the game. I will continue to update my review as I continue to play, but it’s worth noting that this is a short game. I’ve read on the forums that it’s expected to take 4-5 hours to beat, which lines up with my own experience so far.\\n\\n[h1]Positives: [/h1]\\n[list][*]The art here is fantastic. I’m obviously a sucker for cyberpunk, but the pixel art here is really top-notch stuff. The animations are also great.\\n\\n[*]As I mentioned, this is a pretty story-heavy game. Absolutely not what I expected, but it works surprisingly well. The game is well written, and the story is really intriguing. Everything is confusing to begin with and information is revealed to you as you play through the game. \\n\\n[*]The gameplay is tight and can be incredibly fast paced. There have been time where I’ve just kind of flailed around and hoped for the best, but for the most part it remains pretty precise. You blow through levels slicing up enemies as you careen towards an assassination target. You can also slow time and throw projectiles at enemies. Apart from some boss fights, everything here goes down with one hit. \\n\\n[*]Every time you die, you get rewound to the start of the section you’re in. The game feels fair, so whenever I died, I was only frustrated with myself, which is what you really need from a game like this. Figuring out the right way to approach things, or just improve your skills, and then beating a section you found hard is very satisfying. \\n\\n[*]The levels are really well designed, and there’s definitely a noticeable increase in difficulty as you play through. There’s not a huge amount of enemy variation here, so the challenge comes from where enemies are positioned in levels, and what other kind of obstacles there are. It works well.\\n\\n[*]There’s an in-universe explanation for why you’re able to ‘die’ and retry the levels. It’s not super convincing, but I appreciated this detail, nonetheless.\\n\\n[*]The music is fantastic. [/list]\\n\\n[h1]Neutral: [/h1]\\n[list][*]There are a bunch of secret achievements here, the majority of which seem to be related to things that are easily missed while playing. If you’re an achievement hunter, there’s probably some enjoyment to be had in replaying levels to search for things, but if you’re not then I don’t think Katana Zero offers much replay value. [/list]\\n\\n[h1]Negative: [/h1]\\n[list][*]Katana Zero’s biggest problem is that the gameplay doesn’t evolve, at all. You have a sword, you can grab things to throw, and you can slow time [spoiler](later in the game, you do play as a character who has an extra ability, but it’s still not enough)[/spoiler]. All of the game’s mechanics are given to you in the first mission and then that’s it. Like I’ve said, the gameplay is really good, but I was disappointed that nothing new was introduced across the different missions.\\n\\n[*]Enemy variety isn’t great. There are two melee enemies, two ranged enemies, and then one that is a kind of combination of the two. Now, these enemies are well designed and there’s definitely good variation between them, but five enemy types for the whole game didn’t really feel like enough to me. Combine this with the lack of any gameplay evolution, and the variety in the game really takes a hit. The level design is the only thing that keeps the game fresh.\\n\\n[*]As I mentioned up at the top, there are at least two endings for the game. There’s a crossroads kind of moment where you make a choice and you either end the game there or continue playing on. I am now continuing on, but I first chose the other option. I found that ending incredibly lacklustre and really disappointing. This moment in the game is made out to be a really big deal, and if you don’t choose to carry on then it kind of just ends and there’s no resolution to the story, and I felt like there should have been. [/list]\\n\\n[h1]Verdict:[/h1]\\n\\nKatana Zero has some major issues, but that hasn’t stopped me from thoroughly enjoying it. Tight gameplay and an engaging story, what’s not to like? If you’re a big fan of Hotline Miami-likes or games with similar level design to Gunpoint and Deadbolt, I’d recommend giving it a try. But it’s probably best to wait for a sale.\\n\\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider following my curator page: [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33633486/]Kemo's Corner.[/url]\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"[h1][b]Slashing Through the Shadows…[/b][/h1]\\n» [b]Katana Zero[/b] is a blisteringly fast indie slash-em-up with action that is an absolute adrenaline rush. Taking more than a few cues from [b]Hotline Miami[/b], it is largely about a drug-addicted neo-noir-inspired samurai who sticks a bunch of needles in his body. It wears its inspirations on the sleeves of its kimono but refines the tried and true one-hit-kill formula in a manner that makes it feels fresh, exciting, and innovative in surprising ways.\\n\\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\\n» This game puts you in control of a nameless samurai assassin with the power to manipulate time and see into the future. In an extremely clever and fun framing of the action, every level is contextualized as being the planning of an assassination. So, instead of your character dying, you are told “No… That won’t work,” as your precognition rewinds to the start (complete with old-timey VCR effect), giving you a chance to find a solution that does not end in your death. Every level ends with a security camera recording of what “actually” happened, which serves not only as a way to see your moment of triumph played back but also to subvert expectations in interesting ways later on.\\n\\nWorking up to that moment is a blast because Katana Zero’s action is fast-paced and empoweringly flexible. Like Hotline Miami, it is one shot, one kill for both you and any enemy that is not a boss. Your character can slash in eight directions, slow down time, use a dodge roll to avoid bullets or reflect bullets back with his sword. There is a great flow and feel to your character’s movement thanks to small touches like how each sword swing gives you a slight boost of momentum, or how you can cancel out of any roll, and the way each kill gives a satisfying screen-shake and pause to the action.\\n\\nHowever, the most iconic feature of this platformer is the slow-mo effect – specifically, how optional it is. It never feels too strong; it is on a pretty strict cooldown, and since enemies will hear whenever gunfire rings out, you will rarely have time to stay safe long enough for it to replenish. This puts it in a perfect spot as a powerful ability to get you through a tough situation while still being limited enough to keep the action quick.\\n\\n[h1]Story[/h1]\\n» The story of Katana Zero does not quite hit the high note that its action does, but it is at least carried by strong writing and a few great characters, such as your boss/therapist that guides you through your traumatic past while also providing you with the dossiers of people he wants dead, as well as a psychotic Russian adversary named V. It unfolds in a dystopian neo-noir setting, where you are entangled in a web of conspiracies and government experiments. Exploring deep themes of trauma, identity, and the consequences of one's actions, Katana Zero poses itself as a dark and mature tale, artfully woven into the fabric of the gameplay experience.\\n\\nFor instance, there is an innovative dialogue system that allows players to choose unique options based on their timing and interjections. By rudely shutting down conversations or patiently listening, players can unlock different dialogue paths, adding entertaining depth to the game. However, while these choices provide multiple playthrough opportunities, the story deviations feel superficial, and later dialogue options can be inconsistent with previous decisions. Additionally, the game’s narrative leaves much unresolved, hinting at a potential sequel or DLC, but the lack of payoff in this first chapter may leave players feeling unsatisfied.\\n\\nWhile Katana Zero will not take more than four to six hours to complete, it is a very tight four to six hours that cuts out any fluff. It never feels like it is running out of ideas, and every level does a great job of introducing small twists to its simple formula, from an underground minecart level to a motorcycle chase sequence on the city highway.\\n\\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\\n» It also helps that everything looks and sounds great. The slick neon aesthetic and fantastic sprite work go hand in hand with some legitimately impressive 2D lighting effects that give this game a unique visual style and personality. Accompanied by a fitting and catchy retro-electro soundtrack, the audio elements perfectly complement the intense action.\\n\\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\\n» All in all, Katana Zero’s time-bending samurai action is the star of the show here, but it's unique presentation and entertaining dialogue go a long way in supporting a plot that suffers from feeling like it is saving its best ideas for a sequel. As action games go, the game’s shorter length makes it a quick fix, and I’ll no doubt suffer withdrawal while I wait for the next hit.\\n\\n[h1][b]Score: 8.7/10[/b][/h1]\\n\\n[b][i]Was this review helpful?[/i][/b]\\n» If so, please leave a rating.

I enjoyed the game very much and I'd love to see what happens next.\\n\\n[h1]Art[/h1]\\nPixel art that is well animated and engaging. Distopia future style. Extremely violent. Blood can be turned off. There plenty of the 80's Cyberpunk style.\\n\\n[h1]Story[/h1]\\nStory brings in a lot of questions and mystery to every single character. I'd say more but I feel this story needs to be experienced in the way it should be: Through dialogue text boxes. There is a timer on every piece of text and choices to be made within the time. Going through the story once, I can't tell you if choices change the outcome of things. It's engaging to choose a different response on multiple playthroughs.\\n\\nEdit: As I played a little more trying to get achievements, I learned that some answers give you different results in dialogue and give a little more depth to the conversation. Ultimately, your choices in dialogue doesn't change the main outcomes of game endings. Typically, games have a set ending no matter what you choose, simply because there is a narrative to follow or that making multiple endings is much harder to get done.\\n\\n[h1]Music[/h1]\\nTwo people created the music and they did an excellent job giving the thrill and motivation to keep going. Mostly retro synthwave with good dance beats.\\n\\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\\nThe controls seem a little, how should I say, fast but slow at the same time. It's tough to explain, but they are responsive. It's like each thing you do has a small cooldown period.\\n\\nSlash\\nJump\\nDodge Roll\\nSloMo\\nThrow Object\\n\\nYou are thrown into a 2D cross-section of stages with baddies to kill before you can move on. If you die, you have to do the entire room again. The game is super fast paced, even with the slomo gauge.\\nYou are able beat the game without slomo, but this is extremely tough, and should only be done in Speedrun Mode where the enemy spawns are not random. Yes, that's right. In Story Mode, enemies can spawn little off, turned around, moving in a different direction. This can be frustrating to those who want to get past a difficult section by learning a pattern. It can give a sort of fun challenge where it's not the same thing over and over. Things change up, so it doesn't get stale.\\nMy advice is to beat the sections purely based on light planning and reaction time.\\nYou can deflect bullets!\\n\\nAs you progress, new enemy types spring up, but interspersed with the old ones you have seen. Some have much faster reaction times than before. Careful with the muscle guys, their fist swing has a hitbox bigger than expected.\\n\\n[h1]Difficulty[/h1]\\nExpect to die many times. I'd say the game is not too tough, but not for the faint of heart. The game presents you with small sections where it doesn't feel like a unending gauntlet. You do need to think quickly and be on your toes.\\nDeaths are quick and can even be quicker when the rewind feature is turned off.\\nI did not get frustrated at this game's difficulty (Normal).\\n\\n[h1][b]I did not like being shot by enemies off screen.[/b][/h1]\\nBut you can kill people off screen too.\\n\\n\\n[h1]Stuff[/h1]\\nThe game starts you out with a small tutorial to teach you the basics of movement.\\n\\nThere are secrets, easter eggs, and other fun stuff to enjoy as you go through the story. The game is extremely interesting and wanting to have fun everywhere you go. The devs really put in a lot of thought into the games design. Take your time when there is down time.\\n\\n[h1]Small details[/h1]\\nStory Mode - has a slight randomness to enemy location, facing, movement with each respawn from death.\\nSpeedrun Mode - Unlocked after beating the game, with a bunch of nice settings for speedrunners, like removing the randomness if you don't die.\\nHard Mode - Unlocked after beating the game.\\n\\nController support for ALL major platforms - PS, Xbox, Switch, K&M, with icons and labels in their respective setup!\\nMy only tip would be to turn down the camera shake. I turned mine down to 5%. It was too much at max.\\n\\nI sort of wished there was no timer for dialogue, but at the same time the game urges you to just keep moving with your instincts.\\nIt was really fun to be able to NOT use SloMo and get past certain sections. Makes you feel super awesome not to need to slow things down.\\n\\nSpeaking of speed, take a look at the Hitpause option. This is an option where each hit done pauses the action for a fraction of second for dramatic effect. This also gives time for players to take a look around for bullets, but this can slow down and eat inputs. Turn this option down and the game will seem to go even faster and react quicker to your inputs.\\n\\nA lot of the changes in options makes it feel like you're playing a whole new game.\\n\\nI created a small guide on the extras that you hunt down.

Check.[/b]\\n\\n[h1]Yes, that should work.[/h1]\\n\\nCurrently I feel ashamed of myself not playing this gem til early 2020. This is not your everyday pixel hack'n'slash adventure. Katana Zero is a phenomenal game. The way it presents itself is top-notch, the way it takes on dosing is creepily wonderful, and the way the characters develop is beyond your imagination. Plus, its pixel art is beautiful and that, is a big plus to me.\\n\\n[h1]Things I Like About Katana Zero:[/h1]\\n\\n[b]1. Combat System[/b]\\nYou are not any superhero type of guy. You only have one life, just like your enemies. Yet, your greatest advantage over them are the abilities to simulate the situation and to slow down the time. In the gameplay of Katana Zero, every combat in the level is a prediction in your head. The player has to perfectly clear the level in order to proceed. This feature makes every combat unique and a mini of its own. You may clear the level solely with your sword, or you can observe your surroundings and takes advantage of them. The ability to slow things down is your core element in the combat. If you have even a slightest hint of dying, slowing the time is your best bet. This allows you to see how the enemies will react and counter them immediately. These two ideas merge perfectly, and the execution is so satisfying that clearing a room makes you feel stylish and thrilling. Plus, you can deflect bullets back to the owner with a katana. How cool is that!?\\n\\n[b]2. Enticing BGM[/b]\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OylGrT6mK-M&list=PLWCkhGoFcFiw4wIjwIOEk6a3kE_KuHbp2&index=5&t=0s\\nEven when writing this review, I am indulging myself with [i]You Will Never Know[/i] by Bill Kiley. I must compliment the composers of this game. Those people surely know and do a great job of creating background music. In a game which hack'n'slash and good timing happen all the time, players might feel a bit tired of the gore and so many failed simulations. Here is the moment the music actually kicks in. The soundtracks are brisk and pleasant, quite the opposite comparing with the gameplay. This oddity somehow soothes the tediousness of mind, or even accelerates the efficiency of killing. I find myself think better and clearer under the light-hearted tempo the BGM offers, which often leads to faster level completion and a urge for more perfect execution. In another word, I kill faster and better with the music on, just like our protagonist. [strike]Am a psychopath?[/strike] \\n\\n[b]3. Intriguing Story[/b]\\nThe story of Katana Zero is bleak and beautiful. An ex-soldier, now assassin with a mixtape, who can simulate any possible situation in his mind and even slow time, goes on several assassinations and gradually uncover the great conspiracy behind the scene revolving around the drug he is relying on, Chronos. The farther he goes, the more shady and horrifying truth emerge from the surface. Even though the ending is a cliffhanger, the amount of characters development during the assassinations is enough to leave you breathless and you will crave for more. Not only the story is good, the way it present the story is good as well. Our protagonist is on Chronos, which often gives him hallucination and reality shifting. You never know which of which is real. Is the girl really there? Do the masked men really exist? Or is it all just the side effect of the dosing? This part of the story is open for debate, and I love to see community work out the possible whole story.\\n\\n[b]4.

In most games, you listen to the music during your time playing the game, and then you're done with it. But this game's music is different. You will likely listen to it outside of the game (It's on Spotify!). It's really good!\\n\\nGameplay is also fantastic. Lots of slashing with your katana, or use environmental objects such as guns, flamethrowers, vases, etc... There's a lot to do with so few buttons. You dodge stuff, and slash stuff. There is minimal amount of puzzles in this one. It's quite challenging so learning the ins and outs of the combat will make this experience a lot easier. It's not too hard, but mistakes are heavily punished. And ah, dialogue is pretty great, but I'll cover that during the story paragraph.\\n\\nGraphics in this game are awesome.

I have nothing bad to say about the visuals of this game.\\n\\nAnd we reach an important part of this game. It's the story. It's good. The writing is done quite well, and sometimes on the funny side.

It's done really well, and well worth going through other dialogue options besides the main one.\\n\\nKatana ZERO surpassed my expectations, and has done a fantastic job at delivering the final product. I really enjoyed my time with it, and hope it sells enough for the sequel to the story. Unfortunately some complain about the length of the game, but I believe that this length is good enough.

This assassin takes kill contracts from his psychiatrist who supplies him with his daily dose of medicine. He lives in the [b]Third District[/b], a rough area of town with neighbors that are quite loud at night. When sleeping, Zero has nightmares of his past, which he discusses with his psychiatrist. That’s all I can really say about the story, there is much more to it but I want to avoid spoiling the story. \\n\\n[b]Katana Zero[/b] is a very story-heavy game, with that said it manages to bring a sense of mystery around itself after each mission. It’s like [b]Hotline Miami[/b], with all these questions that you will be asking yourself, like what’s the point in doing all of this killing? However, this is something you can change, you can choose to follow the orders given to you by the psychiatrist or not. This helps to bring some depth into the game.\\n\\nThere are also multiple dialog options that you can choose to unravel the story with. You can act nice to the people around you and play it cool or you can be aggressive to everyone around you, it’s an interesting way to interact with the environment. You can also choose to break the flow of the story in your own ways at certain points and it’s something very unique that I found very interesting, it messes with your head.\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2432225475\\n\\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\\n[b]Katana Zero[/b] has some challenging gameplay that you will have to muster your way through to progress. You can kill all the enemies in one hit, however, you can also die in one hit and if you do you will have to redo the level from the start. There are a few objects you can pick up like bottles or statues that you can use to throw at enemies to block a bullet or kill them. There is also a smoke grenade which is honestly my favorite one to use as some enemies will lose track of you to allow for some easy kills.\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2453437579\\n\\nSome missions will require you to be stealthy and this can add some more challenge to the mix on those levels. However, you can also choose to not do that and kill all the enemies on the level. This can add some different dialogue options from different characters and it can proceed the story in different ways.\\n\\nIf you feel up to the challenge, you can also go and play the game on hard mode. In this difficulty, stages will have new variants of existing enemies that will have new ways to attack. Enemies also have increased reaction time and some will shoot you much faster than before so be careful.\\n\\n[b]Zero[/b] has the ability to slow down time for at least a few seconds where he can deflect bullets or dodge certain attacks. This ability can be useful and will save you more times than you think. I should note that you can only use it for a certain amount of time before it needs to recharge. The main things that I found difficult to reflect in this mode were the shotguns and [b]Machine Gunners[/b].\\n\\n[b]Katana Zero's[/b] gameplay is very fast-paced and you will need some quick reaction time to dodge certain attacks. It will ask a lot from you so you will have to get used to what the game will throw at you in terms of difficulty. Another thing that I should mention is that the controls on the keyboard and mouse are a little weird, as the cursor is what direction [b]Zero[/b] will swing his sword at. So let’s say you have your mouse aimed upwards, [b]Zero[/b] will always do an up attack with his katana and this could lead to your death if you were not paying attention to where the cursor is located. I highly recommend using the controller as you don’t have to worry about messing up your slashes.\\n\\n[h1]Graphics and Performance[/h1]\\nI love the pixel art graphics that [b]Katana Zero[/b] has going for it with its neo-like city. Each area you visit is done beautifully and I wish I could look at some of the areas more often but the time limit prevents me from doing so. I tested the game on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, AMD Ryzen 5 1500X Quad-Core Processor 3.50, and 16 GB of RAM. There were no issues present while I was playing and this game should run on almost any computer with no problems. Also the soundtrack is really well done and I loved almost every song that was played.\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2453438798\\n\\n[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]\\nIf you enjoy 2D platformers that provide a challenging experience then I highly recommend [b]Katana Zero[/b]. It has similar things to that of [b]Hotline Miami[/b] in terms of graphics, soundtrack, gameplay, and story. The game is on the shorter side, maybe five or six hours total, so I do recommend purchasing when a sale is going on.\\n\\nThere is also a DLC that is being worked on and from what I hear it is going to be free which will add more to the story. If you plan on playing this game keep a lookout for this.\\n\\nYour mission is to join [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/5297658/] Life Needs a Little Sin [/url] for good quality reviews, burn this document as soon as you are done reading it.\"},\n",

It is a fast, slick and technically demanding 2D action platformer that requires timing, precision and strategic thinking from the player. As shown in my total playtime, I clocked in roughly 14 hours at the time of this review. I completed the main story (which took about 4-5 hours) and hardmode (which took an additional 3-4 hours). The remaining time played was just me dabbling in speedrun mode.\\n\\nThe core gameplay is mostly centered around combat. This includes omnidirectional melee attacks, dodges via rolling, a bullet time mechanic, throwable weapons scattered around each level and various environmental hazards such as turrets and lasers. There are also different types of enemies each with their own of attacks, the gun wielding enemies being the hardest to cut down. That being said, Katana Zero subverted my expectations. I went into the game expecting a pure visceral combat experience but soon realized the game is much more than that. \\n\\nWhat makes Katana Zero so great is that it’s a game about learning. The player dies in one hit regardless of the source, whether it be from an enemy attack or an environmental hazard. Understandably this can be frustrating but at the same time it encourages us to think strategically about our next moves and learn from our previous mistakes.  How should I tackle this room? Which enemy should I hit first? What’s wrong with what I’ve been doing for the past 10 tries? This method might be quicker but it could be more risky? These are the questions I would ask myself while playing the game.\\n\\nThe combat system might look simple at the outset but it is quite nuanced and requires the player to make use of all mechanics in tandem to be an effective killing machine. Melee attacks can be used to deflect enemy bullets back towards them, which is an integral ability to learn in order to master the game. The melee attacks are also omnidirectional and provide the player with multiple ways to slash enemies from various positions. Multiple enemies can also be killed by a single attack if they all are within the attack’s range. Different throwable items carry with it different effects and might be more effective when used on specific enemies. The incentive behind using these mechanics in tandem lies with the delay between each melee attack. \\n\\nFor example let’s say you’ve got 4 enemies in a room. One enemy is a melee based enemy who parries you. The second one wields a pistol, the third an assault rifle and the fourth a shotgun. You can’t run into the room and simply slash everything to bits and pieces. You have tactically decide how to deal with each enemy using all the previously mentioned mechanics. Sure you could go in and first attack the melee enemy but chances are he’d parry you and that window of recovery might leave you open to being killed by the remaining enemies. Instead, why not dodge through the melee enemy’s attack, deflect the pistol wielding enemy’s projectile back towards him, kill the melee enemy from behind, throw the assault rifle enemy with a knife, dodge through the shotgun wielding enemy’s attack and finish him off last? All the while making use of bullet time here and there to ensure your victory? This is just a simple example of what to expect from the game and it can become much more complex during your playthrough.\\n\\nKatana Zero is a challenging but fair game. Throughout my experience, I never felt like the game was unnecessarily harsh and all my deaths were a result of my own mistakes. Enemies are hyper aggressive and will attempt to hunt you down once alerted to your presence so it is best to try and take out as many enemies as possible with the least amount of moves. The bullet time mechanic also helps make things easier but because it depletes much faster than it recharges, it’s not a get out of jail free card and is not an easily exploited mechanic. The addition of a countdown of each room also incentivizes the player to finish the room as fast as possible. Hard mode is far more challenging than the base game and mainly features more enemy placements, hazards etc .There are also a few enemies exclusive to this difficulty.\\n\\nThe story of Katana Zero was surprisingly more complex than I thought and was the main focus of the game. There are various NPCs that offer plenty of dialogue options and the story can get pretty dark. Right off the bat within the first 30 minutes of the game, a mystery revolving around the protagonist is already established and the story becomes more interesting the more we learn about his past. My major gripe with the game is the gameplay feels so good but feels like it takes a backseat to the story. The story is well written and I’m not suggesting they should have neglected it but a few more levels within each stage would have welcomed. Thankfully the developer patched in speedrun mode but this doesn’t really address the issue of a lack of levels. \\n\\nOverall Katana Zero is a great game. The gameplay is superb, the visuals gorgeous and the game boasts a stellar soundtrack. Don’t miss out on this. It’s the best indie game of the year so far for me and I recommend you buy it as soon as you can.'},\n",

And I hope this review will show you why I think that.\\n\\n[u]Pros: [/u]\\nIt's actually really impressive for an indie title. The amount of detail and care put into this game is astonishing.\\nThe art style being retro and pixelated really works in its favor. This would be a really different title if it had PS4 graphics.\\nIt's got great enough gameplay to keep you satisfied for a while.\\nThe soundtrack's an absolute banger.\\nIt's overall just a giant mindfuck. [b]BUT[/b] it's enough of a mindfuck to the point where you can still understand what's going on.\\nCertain aspects of the game aren't explained, but it leaves these points open for interpretation by the community. You can see people coming up with convoluted and complex theories as to what's going on. [spoiler]I've even seen people say that the entire Psychiatrist boss fight didn't even happen at all, and it was just a symptom of the Chronos withdrawal.[/spoiler]\\nThis game does a solid job at balancing emotional parts and action-packed parts.\\nThere are a lot of memorable moments, and it just makes the overall experience better.\\nIt is difficult, but it's difficult enough for a level completion to feel satisfying.\\nThere are really creative and nifty easter eggs and references strewn throughout the game.\\n\\n[u]Cons: [/u]\\nIt's too short. We need more story! (Hopefully the DLC adds more onto it.)\\nNo, really. That's the only con I have.\\n\\nAll in all, a solid 10/10 title for me.\"},\n",

And I still can\\'t stop thinking about it since then.\\n\\nKatana ZERO is a game that has essentially no flaws, at least in my opinion. We\\'ll play as Zero, dubbed \"the Dragon\" for his brutality, a man dressed as a samurai (much to the amusement of other characters) that seems to work as a hitman although not even he knows why or for who.  He just knows he has to carry out these hitman tasks, given to him through the psychiatrist that treats him, because Zero has lost most of his memories and doesn\\'t remember who he is, aside from a recurring nightmare that haunts him. What he does have, however, is the power of seeing the immediate future.\\n\\nUsing this power, he can infiltrate facilities and buildings without being seen, anticipating each of his enemies\\' movements and making a perfect plan to kill everything in sight. This way, the segments you play are actually Zero\\'s plan, and once you\\'ve managed to defeat all opponents in a level, you\\'ll see Zero redo exactly what you did (so a replay), carrying out the plan, but with no bullet-time (did I forget to mention that\\'s a thing too?). This is the way the game explains dying, which you will do, a lot. It\\'s a one hit death for everyone, both you and your enemies, so you will need some trial and error in each level to find out the best way to carry your task. This, if you ask me, is a genius way of explaining death in a video game.\\n\\nThese are the most interesting gameplay points, but definitely not the only good thing the game has to offer. The story is amazing and the way it\\'s told to you is organic and fluid, featuring some great twists, the graphics are beautiful pixel art and the animations are very carefully crafted, the characters are charismatic and well written, the dialogues are entertaining and often funny, the gameplay is super satisfying, everything is just perfect. The game also counts with enough replayability mechanics, which is nice because the game isn\\'t specially long. There are secrets to uncover, new weapons with different ranges and speeds, different paths to take and even a speedrun mode.\\n\\nThe single flaw this game has is that it\\'s not finished. The game doesn\\'t have an ending and the story cuts abruptly. However, it\\'s known that a DLC with more content is being worked on, so I\\'m not worried about that. I\\'m more than happy to wait for more of this masterpiece, one of my favourite games of all time for sure.\\n\\nBuy Katana ZERO. Please. You don\\'t know it yet, but you need it.'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"Let me drink my herbal tea first.\\n....\\nOk, let's go!\\n\\n\\n [b]It was said that this game is going to have DLCs but no DLC was yet confirmed to release any time soon. They are all supposed to be free from what I heard of and they will expand more on the unfinished story. It's definitely worth buying this game tho. Alternatively you can wait for more to release but why would you do that?[/b]\\n------------------------------ [h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]\\nThe game is fast paced and really bloody. The game may sometimes be too fast and that's why there is an ability to slow down time. This allows you to easily deflect bullets or dodge past them.\\nYou don't carry any guns with you so the only long range attack you have is anything you can throw. From knives to bottles or even bust statues.\\nThere are some really underused mechanics like fighting behind a wall where you can only see silhouettes that was only used once as well as the other playable character that you also get the chance to play once. He is able to use dash that would cut all the enemies in front of him in a certain range but after he would be unable to use a sword for a few seconds.\\nWhat I really liked was the swords that you can unlock. They would offer at least some amount of replay ability by having a chance to play the levels in different ways. You can unlock them by finding collectible cards [b](1st can be found when you go left the first time you start to play)[/b]\\n------------------------------ [h1]GRAPHICS[/h1]\\nThe pixel art is so well done and it's nicely detailed which is impressive with the smooth gameplay combined. It is filled with awesome looking neon lighting and you can actually see the light on your character and on others and watch it move as you walk past the source of the light.\\nHowever, the first thing that really hits you, because of the look, is the menu itself. The levels are VHS tapes stacked on a shelf and you can also see the remote too which moves as you rewind or skip certain chapters.\\nAlso the speech bubbles are full of colorful text and they have a nice effect when you interrupt someone where the letters fall out and go off the screen.\\n------------------------------ [h1]SOUNDTRACK[/h1]\\nGreat soundtracks with [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIzZdsItsEY]*Hit the Floor*[/url] and [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj568DGRHGE]*V Limo (New Dong Shi--y)*[/url] being by far the best with [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v_RixPSnL0]*Third District*[/url] which also has some good qualities. Every level offers a unique song that plays as you slash your enemies. I really like how the character puts in his earbuds at the start of almost every level to listen to this awesome music. Tiny attention to details like this really puts this game high among others.\\n------------------------------ [h1]STORY[/h1]\\nThe story gets a little complicated and tangled as it goes but it's really not that hard to put it together. Just kill everyone that gets in your way, right? Well after a while it's not that easy as you start revealing all the lies you've been fed by and after that you slowly uncover your forgotten past.\\nApart from the main story there are nice little side stories like TV broadcasts, everytime you come back home from a mission, that talk about your doings or characters Strong Terry and Slender Richard (later named Skinny Ricky).\\nThe game also explains the reason you can keep dying but still continue to play. I love the game that can do that in such a great way.\\nYou can also choose multiple options that you can say. You can be rude or you can behave. These options can in some cases change some parts of the story that is unfortunately a little bit short.\\n\\n\\n[b]Prepare to take your medicine, kick in some hype music and play KATANA ZERO on a loop.\\n....\\nYes, that should work.[/b]\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': 'Wonderfully animated and beautifully scored, Katana ZERO pretty much exemplifies the best that gaming has to offer in its genre. The core conceit of the game revolves around what amounts to two time altering abilities, a \"bullet time\" slowdown to help the player execute maneuvers with precision, and a \"rewind\" feature for helping iterate strategies for levels until the player gets it just right. While the gameplay is fast paced and high stakes, what makes this game great is not the mechanics alone, but rather how the narrative is perfectly served by those mechanics.\\n\\nTo quote Ron Burgandy: \"Great story. Compelling and rich.\"\\n\\nBut seriously, very few games achieve such a high quality blend of story and design, and while the game can be demanding in its difficulty at points, I believe that it is accessible to anyone with perseverance, rather than some minimum reaction time.\\n\\nThe game should only take you a handful of hours to complete (I spent 7 completing all of the achievements I wanted), which makes this fairly cost effective in the price-per-hour department, and there is an upcoming free narrative DLC that should add more to the story for those who are still somewhat worried about the value of the game.\\n\\n10/10, would drink the soup again.\\n\\nEDIT: Now that the Steam Awards are here, I am adding that I have nominated this game for Game of the Year, through a combination of intense game play, outstanding audio/visuals, and a truly great narrative. If you agree, don\\'t forget to vote!'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"Alright, this game just hits all spots for me. Gameplay is fast paced and makes you feel like a badass, story is interesting and extremely well told with interesting dialogue with many unanswered questions with clues to leave players guessing.\\n\\nSo, gameplay. The gimmick here is that you can slow time (mentally, anyway), which allows you to pull off some moves that would be near impossible in most games. It's fun, fast paced and keeps you on your toes. It gets even more badass when you get to a point where you barely even use time slow anymore and can keep up with the rhythm of the enemies, knowing when they'll shoot before they even do.\\nIt pulls an undertale in acknowledging game mechanics like saving and loading as in game laws, although less obviously as this game uses precognition as the reason, which is an element I found to be very well done.\\n\\nThe story is told extremely well with a surprisingly fleshed out dialogue system, which is something games rarely think to do. It allows you to interrupt people as they're speaking which can really help you get emotionally involved in the situation or just to access funny flavour text. While I won't go too in depth with the story itself, I will say I thoroughly enjoyed it, sometimes even more than the gameplay, and watching the story gradually unfold was one of the most satisfying things.\\n\\nCall me casual, but the only problem I really had with the game was the difficulty that had me baring my teeth at times. But I got through it regardless.\\n\\ntl;dr good game, immersive storytelling and adrenaline rushing gameplay\\n\\nAlternate title: Sekiro: Shadows Don't Die\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"Katana Zero looks like your usual 2D Sidescroller action game inspired by classics like Ninja Gaiden and Shinobi. But there is a twist to the game that is more reminiscent of Hotline Miami than those 8- and 16-bit classics. In this game, every hit is immediately deadly. This goes for your character and the enemies as well. So, naturally, you will die a lot. But you always restart at the same screen to learn from your mistakes and tackle the action in different ways. You could say that Katana Zero is partly a high-speed platformer-action and part puzzle game. The level design is great and open so that more than one path can lead to success. There are only a handful of frustrating passages.\\n\\nTight controls, an awesome pixel art look and some of the best synthwave soundtracks around also make this a very memorable experience. The game is quite story heavy so there is a lot of downtime between the sweaty action parts. The cutscenes and dialogue with some decision making are well-made, but unfortunately, there isn't a satisfying conclusion to all the mystery that is built up over the course of the ~5 hours campaign. Here is hope that the announced free DLC will answer those questions.\"},\n",

[spoiler]they added a new soundtrack and new sound effects to the V boss fight and it\\'s so funny. they added some funny details, like they changed the police car symbols to spirits and dragons, also they added 15\\'s soldier outfit for the tape which was nice. they turned slaughter house to meat facility and it\\'s so freaking funny, also in the bunker you see the body of bunch of nulls in the army suit that 0 and 15 wear, I personally think this will become some important part of the story in the future.

The stages being so short make it easy to not say screw it and rage quit. There are plenty of ways to approach a level too.  Muscle memory plays a big part in this game and makes you feel like a bad ass.

       "  'Review Content': 'Katana Zero has much in common with Hotline Miami. It’s a fast and frenetic action game in which a single hit will kill you, set over a series levels that are subdivided into shorter set pieces and played to a great synth soundtrack.\\n\\nWhile it may at face value appear to be a sidescrolling platform game, combat is very much the focal point of the game’s mechanics with you replaying the current area until you complete it. Although your katana is your main means of dispatching your enemies you also have the ability to dodge, deflect bullets, throw environmental objects and slow down time. Although all of these abilities are available from the start, new types of enemies are gradually introduced as you progress that will put your usage of them to the test. \\n\\nThe various stages are woven together with a trippy story that blurs the line between reality and hallucination. These narrative segments help to balance the pace of the game and often intervene at unanticipated times which helps build a sense of intrigue and keeps you on your toes. The visuals do a good job of bringing the story to life and while not the best example of their kind are stylishly presented in pixelated 2d and are complemented by a fantastic soundtrack that kicks in when the action starts.\\n\\nAlthough the story is relatively modest in length there are a few secrets to find along the way including a secret final boss and you also get access to post game content including hard difficulty and a speed run mode after your first play through.\\n\\nAll in all Katana Zero is a very tidy, but challenging game that is well worth playing if it’s piqued your interest.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"Katana ZERO is Hotline Miami for a new age. All the lore and mysterious character and world building of Hotline Miami in a cyberpunk, Eastern-inspired side-scrolling beat'em up. Katana ZERO's story is hauntingly beautiful, forcing the player to be truly introspective on what the devs are trying to say - a true story of trauma and mental illness that is likely very familiar to many people growing up in the world today. Where its contemporary My Friend Pedro was soulless and uninspired, Katana ZERO is an instant classic not only for the message it portrays but with the rest of the game's aesthetic as well. The anime-inspired character designs are distinct and impressive. The overall visual aesthetic of the game, and the game's graphics as a whole, are drop-dead gorgeous. I loved just idling in quiet areas of the game and picking out all of the impressive details that the devs left for us to see. The soundtrack is INCREDIBLE, comparable in energy and tact only to Hotline Miami's original soundtrack. So essentially you have a game with rock-solid gameplay, easily some of the most detailed pixelated cyberpunk graphics ever created, one of the most memorable OSTs to date, and a backstory/lore that would make RR Martin fans blush... you need to play this game.\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': 'Katana Zero is a game about murder. Which can actually be said about 99% of the games I review.\\n\\nYou play as Zero, a man who can’t remember his past. Zero works as an assassin for an organization in return for a “medicine” that helps him not feel bad. In return, Zero slices up people that...Deserve it? \\nI’m not sure. \\n\\nKatana Zero is a side scrolling game that focuses on fast pace action gameplay while also telling a rather intriguing story about lies, conspiracy, crime, and war. Its kind of proof that you don’t have to skimp out on one to get the other right. While the gameplay isn’t the most complex thing in the world, what it does it does really, really well. \\n\\nMuch like the weird kid in high school, you use a katana to ward off other human beings. Each level is played like Zero is planning out his attack, with the one you succeed in being the plan that works, after each stage, you get to see how it looked through a security camera, giving every stage this found-footage feel. \\n\\nZero can attack, dodge and jump as well as slow down time for a certain period. You mix these together with other abilities like throwing items, deflecting bullets with your sword, and setting up traps to take out multiple enemies at the same time. The game isn’t a cakewalk, but when you get going, you get going. Its fast paced and exciting to cut up a bunch of fools and not look like a clown while doing it. \\n\\nBetween missions, the story will play out with you choosing what Zero says. Sometimes, depending on what you say, certain story events will play out differently. There’s even a point where, if you’re feeling particularly glue-eating that day, you can lose your sword for the majority of the next mission. \\n\\nKatana Zero is also one of those pixelated 2D games, but it decided to play off that and dedicate to the artstyle instead of just using it as an excuse to make Atari graphics and call it the SNES. The Pixel art and backgrounds in Katana Zero are--\\nI don’t know, whats a funny way to say “really really good?” \\n\\nJuicy.\\n\\nKatana Zero’s pixel art is juicy. \\n\\nI’m not sorry. \\n\\nNew Mecca looks like a place I would actually like to visit, even though I know its a shit hole, or at least the District you’re in is. It punches all the right buttons on the “Things Dirk likes” soundboard. Beautiful twilight-lit skies, neon signs illuminating the night-time streets, long stretches of urban apartments, gives me that ~Aesthetic~ feel. \\n\\nThe soundtrack is also bopping, a nice mix of beats that keep the game going. It even has an in-universe reason to be there with Zero putting in earphones before a mission. I’m not really a music guy, so I can’t comment more on that.\\nGive me money and I can pretend to be a music guy, however. \\n\\nKatana Zero was a really fun time, I started it up and didn’t stop until I finished it six hours later. There are a bunch of achievements I missed, so I might go back to that sometime in the future. There’s more content on the way, or so I’ve been told.\\n\\nSpecial Thanks to Serc for sending me a free copy of this, he told me to review it and also called me a bad name, so I kind of had to or else he’d do it again and I’d cry. \\n\\nIts one of those indy games that actually tries, which is always admirable, especially so if the game is good. Go check it out, you’d probably like it. \\n\\nKatana Zero gets Sixteen Dirks going on Coldsteel to buy swords out of 10. \\n\\nPringles aren’t actually potato chips. \\n\\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/7124597/] Join the curator, or the nightmares will start again.

That satisfaction allows KZ to last even longer than it should, as there's nothing to stop you from jumping into previously completed levels & trying things out perhaps you couldn't pull off when just starting out. If good mechanics alone aren't enough to get you replaying a 4-5 hour campaign, I'd still suggest it to be worth the money, but you might want to exercise a bit more caution.\\n\\nPresentation is also right up there, with the superbly executed Hotline Miami influenced ultra violent aesthetic driving a surprisingly interesting story. It's message response options often open the door to wildly differing conversational outcomes, which I enjoyed messing around with a bit given how enjoyable & funny the writing is, although even then, there were times where I just wished I could skip ahead & get to the combat again, as that's the real highlight of the title (alongside the OST).\\n\\nExtras? Speedrun mode, a hard mode, different weapons? Yup, they're all present & correct (after beating the game, of course)! The speedrun mode is very customizable, & where I personally find the value in the game to be. My only real complaint is there doesn't seem to be any sort of in-game leaderboard, so the only way to compare scores with your friends is the old fashioned way of just showing em a picture - Which is fine! But hey, a leaderboard would've been nice. Still, with features like level by level death/time tracking, the ability to skip any & all story content, use different weapons & so on, paired with its satisfying gameplay, make KZ a very appealing title for speedrunners of all levels.\\n\\nOverall, I enjoyed my time with Katana ZERO quite a lot, & wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone who feels they'd be able to find value in the post game extras/speedrunning aspect of it. If replaying/speedrunning isn't really your thing, I'd still very much recommend it, albeit with a lot less enthusiasm.\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': 'This is a fun and challenging side scrolling \\'instant kill\\' game. You are given an interesting amount of movement options, weapons, and special abilities to fight, and enemies get progressively more difficult to deal with, or at least in more unique ways of combating. Movement itself can be a bit finicky, and while new features are introduced and explained well, the layout on keyboard can be a bit cramped when you need to pull off precise movements and inputs in a row. \"Aiming\" with your sword strikes in particular often cancels your movement unless you have both positioned perfectly, which is hard to do simultaneously when adapting to combat. The quick nature of respawning does ease this problem. The main game is just a few quick hours, but alternative objectives and new game plus modes most likely add replayability. A few mechanics and elements feel like untapped potential. The story is mysterious, thrilling, and shocking, and allows for some choice in dialogue and light branching story, although this would be better if more fleshed out with more routes and choices affecting the story or gameplay more. Music and presentation are excellent, a very flashy and colorful aesthetic. Certainly a blast to play through and discover. This is a very good foundation, but would be a must play with some polish, better features and customization options, and more campaign content. 7.8 out of 10 for the strong gameplay and killer story, but with a bigger scope than presented and elements that will hopefully be addressed in a sequel.'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"Indie games tend to lean heavily between gameplay and story.  Usually one is definitively the lead foot and the other is less of a focus for the developers.  Once in a while, a smaller developer brings a little more to the table, maybe making a more balanced game in those categories.  Katana Zero, however, is one of the first times I’ve seen so much effort placed in both creating compelling gameplay and a dense story coming out of an indie studio.\\n\\nAbbreviated Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37Dt2XHia1o\\n\\n[h1]The Familiar Territory[/h1]\\nDevolver Digital seems to enjoy publishing indie games that feature violent protagonists and instant or near instant kills.  Katana Zero takes after the recently release Ape Out and genre-defining classic Hotline: Miami by putting you in the role of a character with a penchant for violence and a katana that is exceptionally good at making your enemies dead.  However, in playing it, it reminded me significantly of another non-Devolver game – Door Kickers: Action Squad.  You see, in every mission, you’re usually assigned the role of heading into a building or facility and assassinating target.  This involves bursting through a number of doors and obliterating opponents as quickly as possible.  In practice, it feels so similar to that game (along with the synthwave aesthetic) that I would have assumed the same company developed them if I didn’t know any better.  However, the real meat of the gameplay involves a time-warping mechanic that is very distinct to Katana Zero.\\n\\nTwisting time takes a couple of forms within the game.  You already have the lightning fast ability to swing your sword and throw various objects around the map, but you can also slow down time to better execute some of the trickier maneuvers in the game.  For instance, you can deflect bullets back at their source with a well-timed sword slash, but achieving this without slowing down time can be tricky – even though if you actually do it, you feel like a badass.  Slowing time can also allow you to make better use of your (i-frames included) dodge roll that is often the deciding factor between life and death.   Yet death isn’t really that much of a problem for this protagonist. \\n\\n[h1]It’s Rewind Time[/h1]\\nPart of the 80s synthwave aesthetic is that you ‘rewind’ time, much like a VCR (tape lines included), to go back to the beginning of the room and try it all again.  This essentially makes it impossible to lose, but you can still fail as many times as you can tolerate it.  There will be points where it feels like Super Meat Boy in how many times you suck and have to restart, and just like that classic game, you’ll start hating portions of the game where you just can’t seem to get the timing down.  These moments actually play into the game and become part of the story in a way that I don’t want to spoil, but made encountering a fail state multiple times feel like there was always a chance to trigger something cool.  It made a great connection between the key gameplay mechanic and the story itself.\\n\\n[h1]The Story Itself[/h1]\\nKatana Zero is a short game, so the story picks up quickly - meaning there aren’t many things I can talk about without spoiling it.  However, I can also say the story is so erratic and at times hard to follow that I don’t know if I outright tried to explain it, I’d be accurate enough to say it ruined anything.  Regardless, one of the main threads is that you are in the role of an ex-soldier who is a veteran of a war in the game lore who is working as an assassin.  In this work, you see a psychiatrist who seems to be in the role of helping you get past the literal nightmares and metaphorical demons of your past with a combination of dialogue-option filled discussion and injections of a mysterious drug.  Yet, he also hands you dossiers on the targets for each of your missions, making his role a little strange to say the least.  \\n\\nThe initial mystery of the story element is compounded through your interactions both during and after when you return to your apartment.  Characters can pop in without notice and seem to know you, but it you don’t know if it’s someone your character is or isn’t supposed to know.  Every character is written with a motive that you’re unsure whether it directly revolves around you or not.  As the story progresses and becomes more layered and complex, you start to see what some of those characters’ motives were and learn more about yourself as the protagonist.  What makes the story the most compelling, and what may be the most frustrating thing to some people, is that you’re often offered a lot of choices in the dialogue that may play out in your actions and you have no idea if it would lead to real change in the game.  It’s hard to say if selecting one choice over another would a different outcome, but it’s actually one of the things I ended up loving.  At one point, you can even select an option that gives you a game over screen, complete with credits, and you just have to go back and choose the alternative.  \\n\\n[h1]Perfectly Balanced, as all things should be[/h1]\\nHaving an indie game with good gameplay or a good story is great.  Having one with both is even better.  However, having a game with both supporting one another is just amazing.  Katana Zero is amazing.  Even in my moments of frustration when I had no idea what the hell I had to do to beat an area or a boss, I still felt like the goal was within reach.  The story had me looking for more, thinking back through everything I had done and every event that occurred trying to better understand what was going on.  I wanted more of both, and that is one of the shortcomings of the game.  I finished it in just under four hours and that included some time spent messing around looking for achievements.  While the $15 price isn’t overwhelming, some more frugal players may want to wait for some kind of sale if they expect more time for their money.  I have heard that DLC is on the horizon with support for speed runners and such, so that may be something to wait for as well if you’re on the fence.  Either way, this is a must-play game for whatever price you’re willing to pay. \\n\\n[quote] If you'd like to see more of my reviews, check out my curator page here: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28346672-Endyo-Gaming/ and https://bagogames.com/[/quote]\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': 'The concept of time has long provided fertile ground for philosophical debates. The way we perceive it and how drugs can alter it can turn those philosophical debates into trippy affairs, as well as horror stories. Katana Zero is a pretty good application of that. Set in a cyberpunk world, with neo-noir undertones. You are playing an elite assassin, not very imaginatively named Zero, with a peculiar relationship with time. Zero is caught in the typical web of evil conspiracies of ominousness. Represented by his handler, who happens to aptly be his psychotherapist, his source of missions and medicine, ostensibly for his mental well-being. Armed with a bathrobe and a katana, you guide Zero as he carves a (very) bloody path through everyone and everything in his way as he tries to take back control of his destiny.\\n\\nThe game touches some pretty heavy themes. War, psychopathy, PTSD to name a few. And of course the perception of time. As Zero\\'s powers and drug problems increase he becomes more and more unable to tell where reality ends and delusion begins. As time bends and shifts his foretold final fate may be about to kick in, or perhaps has already happened. Narratively the game is very strong. There may not be that much happening but what\\'s there feels very personal. This, along with the trippiness present, make it very compelling. It helps that the game is very heavily stylized, with the entire presentation working to strengthen the experience. The music that Zero plays in his Walkman throughout missions is an example. Very fitting for the genre and organically tied to the narrative. Even the game\\'s interface seems intent to mess with your mind. \\n\\nThe game\\'s core gameplay loop is effectively that of a 2D action-platformer. Each level consists of a series of areas filled with enemies. Zero needs to either dispatch or avoid them all. Armed with his katana, all kinds of throwable items and time powers. The action is high stakes. As powerful and deadly as Zero may be, he is just as fragile. An enemy as much as sneezing on him will send you back to the beginning of the current area. One hit and you need to start again. This is quite innovatively worked into the game\\'s narrative, via the aforementioned time powers. Zero can predict the future and select the timeline in which he succeeds to become reality. Trippy but conceptually effective. Unfortunately, that doesn\\'t mean you, the player, can do the same. As such the constant pursuit of the perfect run can make the game feel repetitive.\\n\\nThankfully, the potentially repetitive gameplay doesn\\'t detract significantly from the experience. Unfortunately, the finale does. Or rather the lack of one. Katana Zero is incomplete. The game ends with a \"to be continued\" note, which happens right when the plot is about to reach its climax. Nothing is sorted out, it\\'s one enormous cliffhanger. There was a promised free DLC that would continue the narrative, but that was years ago. Not sure if it\\'s still happening or if it makes sense to even take it into consideration anymore. As it stands the game ended so abruptly I was left in disbelief. Besides, the duration of the game is hardly satisfactory. It took me about four hours to finish it. About seven to see most of what it had to offer. This certainly doesn\\'t win the game any awards for copious amounts of content.\\n\\nSo do I recommend Katana Zero? Well, as a game it\\'s not particularly interesting. The gameplay is acceptable but hardly groundbreaking and potentially repetitive. As an experience though it becomes a much stronger sell. It\\'s evocative and powerful, the way the narrative is presented, the style, the concept, all of it is praiseworthy. The lack of an ending and the short duration may reduce the overall effectiveness of the experience, but not enough to make it lose its allure. As long as these concerns are factored in and deemed acceptable, then Katana Zero becomes an easy thumbs up.'},\n",

Although a lot is left unexplained, I really love that I was left with a lot of theories related to the story and I hope that the free DLC the developers have promised will answer most of my questions and bring us more of this beautiful game. A lot of people complain that it\\'s short, but after taking my time to answer during a dialogue and choosing how I want to complete a mission I was given, it felt that more time has passed than it actually did and that is something that amazed me, it\\'s the quality of time, not the quantity. Be it short and good, rather than long and boring. \\n\\n[b] Pros: [/b]\\n\\n[b] 1. Well written dialogue. [/b]\\n\\nThe writing is very good and the way it\\'s presented in the game it\\'s something fantastic. The developers used a method to incorporate \"voice acting\" in the game by giving the text change of colour, different animations and types of speed, that indicate the tone of dialogue. You are offered various dialogue options to choose from during the countdown, be it rudely interrupting (resulting in the shatter of the text box) or taking your time to choose the most appropriate answer. Your dialogue options will have an impact on your conversation and also change aspects of the story. [spoiler] Choosing specific dialogue options and executing missions in a specific way will unlock a secret boss fight. [/spoiler]\\n\\n[b] 2. Easy to learn, but difficult to master gameplay. [/b]\\n\\nZero moves like a ninja, he can dodge roll, slash his sword, deflect enemy bullets, slow down time and pick up various items, later to be used if wanted. Slowing down time sounds overpowered but cannot be done over and over, the more you use it, the more the battery icon displayed on your HUD (top left) will drain. Zero has no health bar, meaning every mistake you make that will cause you to be fatally wounded will result in a restart of the room you\\'re in. Each room has a timer, meaning you must complete the room before the time runs out. Optionally, after unlocking 5 secret swords, you can choose to equip one sword at the time, each sword having it\\'s own ability. After finish the game once, you unlock speedrun, where you can play on hard more, or test your skills on normal difficulty. [spoiler] During one level you will be playing as a character named Fifteen aka The Dragon, that can also slash his sword, deflect bullets, dodge roll, but his ability to pick up items is replaced with an instant dash in a straight line that kills every enemy in it\\'s path. This ability has a cooldown, during it\\'s cooldown you cannot attack or use the slash dash ability again. [/spoiler]\\n\\n[b] 3. Very well made soundtracks. [/b]\\n\\nAn aspect where the game excelled. The soundtrack is amazing, making it fit perfectly the scenery or the situation you are in. It can be relaxing, mysterious or edgy. The composers made awesome tracks for this game and I love it.\\n\\nLet\\'s appreciate that the game itself has only 200+ MB and managed to fit so much in it.\\nI have nothing to complain about the game, in what I have written above I hope I proved that this game is worth playing at least once or as many times as you wish. I give it a solid [b] 10/10. [/b]'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"Katana Zero is a stylistic indie action game about a conspiracy involving supersoldiers, war crimes, and using cosplay as a cover while you assassinate someone. It features frenetic gameplay where the titular character slices and dices through waves of Greasers with just a sword. Death can happen with a single hit but players are allowed to rewind and retry as many times as their patience allows. After each segment, players watch a short replay in real time, making them appear quite skillful, but this disrupts the Mach 5 pace of the game. In my opinion, the replay should be at the end of each level.\\n\\nWhat might surprise players is the strength and quality of Katana Zero's narrative, as it uses unconventional storytelling and unreliable narration to tell a dark but believable story of PTSD set in a bleak, dystopian world. There are moments showcasing the shocking nature of humanity but it never borders on pretentiousness or over-indulgence. Accompanying the plot is an excellently produced soundtrack featuring brooding synths by Ludowic and catchy house-like pieces by Bill Kiley. \\n\\nIf I had a nickel for every time Devolver published a colorful, hyper-violent, one-hit death game about a protagonist threatened by Russians, I'd have two nickels.

Sure, many may point to the 4 hour play time (despite more content seemingly coming) and sit there going that the price tag may be too much. But that would be the case if the game wasn't as polished as Katana Zero is. I mean, it helps that the game has reasonably replayability with the story paths and the gameplay has a natural flow to it, where you get lost in the beautiful environments. There's something badass about seeing your replay in full speed, as you see how you were able to reflect the bullet right back in the head, or dodge roll at the right time to slash at an enemy. Rarely do I say the game is for everyone, but I feel that Katana Zero hits a wide arrange of wants/positives that everyone can enjoy elements of it. \\n\\nEnemy variety may be lacking for some, but it works for me here as it takes reasonably different tactics to deal with each, and the level design uses those enemies rather well in placing the samurai in new situations. I do appreciate that those who really get prediction timing down don't actually need the time slow mechanic most of the time, and I can see speed runs becoming popular with the game due to that element. Boss fights were simple but effective, and the game hung around long enough with gameplay variety to never feel boring, but not strained out. Sound design is on point, along with a set of music tracks that are appropriate to the  \\n\\nThe surprise of this package however is the story, which has multiple layers exploring themes of the savage nature of war, the use of drugs to cure one's self, and various other heart touching topics. There's a small series of characters that all have reasonable definition, including the little girl which you want to protect no matter what it takes. You connect with our main samurai, you want to take his persona as you interrupt the enemy's dialogue, and while you may not get the conclusion you want yet, it's a story that's worth following and not just a thrown in segment for a indie game. There's a ton of depth here, and one I'll be coming back to. \\n\\nHonestly, I'm sitting here wondering if I gave the game too low of a score after re-writing this after doing the video review. It's still a must buy no matter what. A great example of modern day video games.\\n\\n[b]Video Review: [/b]  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNKIIgJC_4c \\n\\n[u] Lists: [/u]\\n[b]Positives:[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Love that the slow down mechanic still takes skill: rapidly hitting the slash button will punish you: not many slow down mechanics do that.\\n[*] Enemy Design is simple and straight forward, but takes different tactics with shotgun enemies and shield swat members.\\n[*] Level Design uses the enemies well in placement, and despite there's repetition, it never FEELS the same. \\n[*] Crisp controls are perfect for the gameplay.\\n[*] Great speed running possibilities. \\n[*] Story has a lot of layers to it and has a lot of emotional depth. Fantastic.\\n[*] The samurai/little girl connection is touching and is surprising because those types of connections for me feel forced. Relatable dialogue and charm push Katana Zero past that trope.\\n[*] Replayability in the dialogue tree. \\n[*] Movement is crisp and feels excellent: punishing you for imprecision but not feeling like you're bashing your hands against the keyboard to get things to work.\\n[*] Sound Design does well to give you feedback, but doesn't over do it. \\n[*] Music OST is going to be one to listen to outside of the game. Great action music. \\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*]  Some people may say it's short at 4 hours. I think it's fine at its length (with more to come) but I can see why people wanted more.\\n[*] I feel like I have to wait for the “true” ending (I might have missed it though), but I'm really stretching for negatives here. \\n[*] There can be a frustration factor here in the middle third....I guess.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b] If you want more reviews/information regarding games I've reviewed, visit my curator.

       "  'Review Content': 'Katana Zero is a side scrolling hack and slash platformer where you need precision control to murder your way through each stage, as you try to uncover your past. It offers plenty of fun gameplay as you master your abilities, and a fairly free ability to make the story evolve as you want to along with a pumping soundtrack. I highly recommend playing it if you haven’t already, though an average run only last a few hours.\\n \\n[b]Story[/b]\\nYou play as an amnesic katana wielding assassin who can slow down time and uses precognitive abilities to plan your path through stages. I found the story great, and it had plenty of twists I didn’t expect and kept me guessing as to what was real and what the character was imagining until it all came together in the end, though there are a few lose plot points I wish the game explored further. It feels heavily influenced by the Vietnam War, and has equivalents of a lot of controversial topics. Between each mission you have therapy sessions with your shrink to help with your PSTD from the war you fought in, and nightmares after each completed mission. Depending on how targets were eliminated, dialogue options you pick and if you follow orders the story re-frames itself, which can keep you (the player) in the dark about what is happening, or completely change your perception of what’s happening. Are you a war vet having a mental breakdown, a pawn of a clandestine shadowy government operation, or something else? I didn’t see the ending coming, which totally puts a different slant on the entire game.\\n\\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\\nWow. I found this seriously fun to play. The gameplay is simple, but requires a good deal of precision as you dodge, slow down time, throw object and reflect bullets back at enemies as you work towards each target. Even being out slightly results in death, and results in a restart of the screen you are on, but thankfully each stage is small so you aren’t losing tons of time and effort with each death. Each of the stages is well designed, with a few different options for you to move around as you murder your way through to your target. Every enemy needs to be dealt with, you mission guidelines don’t allow you to leave anyone alive. After each mission you have the option of watching your run, which I thought was fairly cool.\\n\\nEnemies are copies of each other so you know their attack profiles, and while they might be generic they are deadly. All of them are crack shots if you are standing still or not using your abilities, and throw in some of the traps found in each stage or environmental hazards makes for interesting combat. You have a few different one time objects you can find scattered across each stage which can be thrown at enemies or used to help you progress. \\n\\nThe game isn’t afraid to change things up, some missions have you progressing while remaining unseen (like sneaking into a prison or nightclub), and encourage you to not kill anyone, while a later stages has you babysitting a mining kart while racing to hit the track mechanisms to keep it moving. There’s a stage where you are chasing down a boss and killing mobs while riding a motorbike down the highway, and a stage where you control someone else who has similar abilities to you but is more in control of them.\\n\\nBoss fights are interesting, with some of them skipping ahead if you fail enough, but most require the precision fighting techniques to pass, and become easier when you have the patterns figured out. The hidden boss fight was a great Akria reference!\\n\\nThe game has some replayabilitiy in the fact that you can load up missions and change your response to certain areas, which can change future outcomes. This can change what you experience in the nightmares and potentially opens up a secret boss, as well as achievements. There is also a hard mode and speed run mode for those who wish to test themselves. \\n\\n[b]Graphics[/b]\\nThe game is pixel based, but looks great with that aesthetic. As you kill enemies, the blood sprays over the walls and furniture, leaving you painting the stages with enemy’s blood. It’s easy to tell where you are and if enemies can see you or if they are alerted, though I ran into a few instances where the enemies were shooting at me from off screen. Depending on the character’s state of mind screen distortion or other effects can occur which messes with you, and feeds into the story. I didn’t experience any issues or bugs while playing the game, it feels highly polished.\\n\\n[b]Music[/b]\\nThe soundtrack is heavily synth based, with a large dose of drums. I found the soundtrack great to listen to, with their being plenty of variety and the mission music kind of energising you, while the music outside of stages feeling dark. Its available as a separate purchase if soundtracks are your thing.\\n\\n[b]Achievements[/b]\\nMost of the achievements are easy enough to get, however the speedrun and hard mode might cause issues for some.\\n\\nFor more reviews please visit https://store.steampowered.com/curator/31327216/'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"https://youtu.be/CN7Q0rgSUoI\\n\\nAn artistic and nostalgic game about fighting, dying and a beautiful friendship between a killer and a little girl. Katana ZERO allowed me to feel like I'm playing Hotline Miami 2 for the first time again, something very valuable for me. After having it in my library for one week I decided to try it out. Unfortunately I started it in the evening. It's 7AM and I just finished it, I'm a bit tired but I don't regret anything. \\nEverything you need to know is that you're a samurai and the game exists in your head, you won't make any move until you get things done without being harmed in your mind, then do exactly the same in his real world. You can only die in your mind and if you do you get sent back to a checkpoint. As long as you take your medicine you are immortal.\\nThe chat is something special that I haven't seen in any other game, heard about immortality talking in Undertale (Thanks Sans, very cool), but in tiny amounts. What it really is you will find by yourself if you decide to play this artistic game, it is something that's a crime to spoil.\\nThe soundtrack genres differ on what you are doing: Vaporwave and Synthwave for fighting, Jazz for relaxing at home and Hardbass for arguing with idiots while receiving russian swearing. I loved it.\\nAs I said up there, the game is very aesthetic. The pixel graphics look very nice, I prefer those over ultra realistic graphics. This is the best and one of the cheapest purchases i made for the past year. \\n\\nIf my eyes were still working I noticed that the game was made totally by one person (excluding the music and publishing). Katana ZERO is my dream, my dream being to make such a video game, one so fun, beautiful, well written, a game that people would review like I do right now. The game is simply amazing.\\n10/10\\n\\nIf you want more detailed reviews on awesome games consider following [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/35565038/]Aqua Justice[/url], our curator page.\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"[h1]The top review is the TL;DR. If you want a more in-depth analysis check the one below![/h1]\\n\\nKatanaZero is, in all senses of the word, a gaming masterpiece. The writing is complex but manages that complexity with perfection, the game mechanics, slowing time, are unique and executed amazingly, the neon VHS cyberpunk-esque artstyle fits perfectly and, in terms of difficulty, it feels just hard enough to make you push, think and adapt. \\n\\nThis is a must-buy; if you don't own this game already you must buy it! This is what I consider to be a perfect game.\\n\\n[hr][/hr]\\n\\nKatanaZero is an exploration into the effects of war, drugs, PTSD and discovery of self; each moment in this game, outside of the mindless slaughter, explores a deep, gritty part of human nature. You play as Zero and, without spoiling too much of this one-of-a-kind story, you spend the entire game choosing a path which will explain as much or as little of his backstory as you choose. KatanaZero does not stray away from the worst part of what makes people human instead it embraces it and uses it to magnify their narrative. This, combined with a perfect score by LudoWic and Bill Kiley, creates what I consider to be the perfect game as it plays like your classic side-scrolling platformer hack-n-slash but [b]feels[/b] like an investigation into man and it's greatest mistakes.\\n\\nI must warn people who are considering playing this game: it is very raw and graphic for a pixel game; you will feel very vulnerable and emotionally-defenceless but by embracing that moment of weakness you will experience this to it's absolute fullest. \\n\\nKatanaZero is a must-buy. It's not just a perfect game that's an immense understatement; This is art. In the ever-growing battle between what is and is not art this is one of the greatest examples of live-art. \\n\\nRating: 10 / 10\\n\\nThank you Askiisoft.\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': 'It\\'s Neo-Noir alright.\\n\\nFor the most part, Katana ZERO is what it looks like. A fast-paced slasher-platformer with instant death and time manipulation. It\\'s easier than you\\'d expect (from Hotline Miami for example) but still non-trivial, and you can choose not to use time slowdown. But let\\'s be honest: gameplay is not the main draw here, at least it wasn\\'t for me.\\n\\nIt\\'s the story. More specifically, the way it\\'s told.\\n\\nThe game takes the concept of \"unreliable narrator\" and runs with it... but just carefully enough to make you actually wonder what\\'s real and what\\'s not. Classic Noir; and Katana ZERO iterates on this concept with creative usage of glitchcore. And when you throw in some serious mental health issues and drugs into the mix... well, the result is potent.\\n\\nThen, there\\'s the aesthetic. Some people think that pixel art is \"bad graphics\"; I won\\'t insult you by assuming you\\'re one of them. Instead I\\'ll point out that the sprites are detailed and expressive, and the animations are very smooth with lots and lots of frames. They\\'re also very varied - for example, there\\'s a mission that takes place in a club, and there\\'s an animation of the protagonist dancing - just for this one room. \\n\\nOn the topic of clubs; the music is very fitting. \"Dark synthwave\" would be my best attempt to categorise it? Slower, heavier Carpenter Brut? A little like Hotline Miami\\'s, but less flashy? I don\\'t know, I review games, not music.\\n\\nFinally, I have a complaint. The game\\'s story isn\\'t self-contained - it ends on a cliffhanger of sorts. Still, it\\'s a Noir story, so a certain lack of closure is fitting. Besides, the rest is so good I can forgive this little thing.\\n\\nWith all that said, I don\\'t think Katana ZERO is as good as the reviews make it look. It\\'s polished and has interesting narration, but something felt missing the entire time I was playing. Maybe I simply didn\\'t like the gameplay all that much. Maybe the plot was  too... \"snuff\" for me. Or maybe I found the general story a little too vague. But overall I had fun and the plot kept my attention, and I\\'d say the game\\'s definitely worth playing.\\n\\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42922988/]Curator Page[/url]'},\n",

Be wary if you haven't completed the game, and please do. --\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis genuinely has to be my one of- if not my favorite pieces of fiction ever.\\n\\nThis game is one of the best examples I can give to anybody that shows great writing, artstyle, representation, and musical talent.\\n\\nKatana Zero is not only a fun game, but an amazing game. With rapid, satisfying movements that feel deserved depending on the actions you do in gameplay, nothing feels entirely unfair or downright stupid. It eases the player into gradually harder difficulty while not doing it instantly or too slowly; it's just right.\\n\\nThe music is phenomenal, showcasing intense songs that compliment the fast-paced gameplay, but also calming down at important story points- or even getting more intense. Basically, the music goes along with what's happening currently very well. Plus I just love listening to it on my free time, if that says anything.\\n\\nThe story is something I genuinely adore. While as of now not everything is clear but eventually could be as the arrival of the DLC is still being awaited- it keeps you intrigued. Not only does it display great examples of withdrawal and what being on a drug does to you, but also expresses the mental state very well. We don't know much about our protagonist Zero, and even less about his companion Fifteen, but we for sure know that both of these individuals aren't ok. Zero's thoughts and having options in the game such as defying your therapist and killing innocents like a homeless man give a glimpse into his deterioration, and like said before withdrawal. One of these examples being the rooftop scene. We know Zero's done some horrible things in his life according to the church scene, and we know he regrets them via his words. But, he knows he's done at least one good thing in his life that can't hold him down. Zero's perception of time is fucked frankly, and he is severely mentally damaged, but he isn't heartless. He's a very caring character with his own motivations, and I love him.\\n\\n\\nAll in all, I do love this game. I replay it time and time again or even just a quick session to see some bodies drop, and always remember the importance of this game.\\n\\nI await the DLC and genuinely hope for it soon.\\n\\n\"},\n",

I couldn't put it down, also combining both gameplay and story into a major bit of plotpoints is also very much a thing I enjoy. \\n\\nThis game is quite depressing and entirely intense. Although there are a few comedic moments. Such as the girl who thinks you're a cosplayer, and if you play along with it. \\n\\nThe music is spectacular. Very for the setting they're going for. If you're looking for a dramatic tale that has a Samurai fighting mobsters, police and other folks. Go for it, but do be warned the death toll is high.\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"Katana Zero is a slick side scrolling 2d Action game that mixes gritty cyberpunk aesthetic with 80's neon, stirs in some Hotline Miami game stylings, and serves it up in a cool smoothie cup. It's one shot one kill, high reflex perfect execution all the way through, and tells a war-drama story behind mysterious machines, child soldiers, and drug running.\\n\\nThe game has detailed pixel art and an electronic soundtrack that keeps you focused on the action, and recognizing everything happening at a glance, while still making everything look stylish, and fitting the game's overall aesthetic. Your character moves with a steady flow, and does so responsively. The game's story is about a mysterious samurai who appears to act as the assassin for his therapist, who dispenses medicine, biting sarcasm, and new missions, in equal measure. The game quickly spirals out as you learn more about the world's politics, wars, and governmental black ops, including secret super-soldier projects. The game takes place over distinct levels with walking and dialogue sections, and then action sections, broken down into levels.\\n\\nThe meat of the game is these action sections, where your job is generally to kill every single person in an area, from club wielders, to pistoliers, machine gun users, and more. Every enemy type acts predictably, meaning you can lure enemies around, know what they'll do and how they'll react, and be in total control. On top of that, you have the ability to slow down time, reflect bullets, pick up and fling objects, and dive in and out of cover. At the end of your carnage, you're treated to an optional view of what happened from the POV of a security camera in normal time, which can be fun to watch if you made excessive use of the slow time power. Every enemy dies in a single hit, and so do you, so combat becomes a planned dance of katana slashes, diving under stairs, throwing trophies and fire extinguishers, and dodging and reflecting bullets, before standing alone in a sea of blood. Each mission has different twists to mix it up, and the game throws consistent new challenges and situations at you all the way to the end. It's not a long game, so it never wears out its welcome.\\n\\nThe game does dialogue interestingly, where you can interject and interrupt dialogue, or wait for it to play out, then make decisions. In practice, this doesn't generally affect gameplay - there's no real decision branches - but it does add a feel to the game where you can react to situations how you'd like, playing hard and aggressive, or more thoughtful, both in dialogue and gameplay. Though not affecting mechanics, it gives more immersion.\\n\\nOver the course of the game, there's also some secrets and unlockables, and when you beat the game, you can use them in future play modes, like different weapon types, various speedrunning, modes, and a secret, hidden boss near the end of the game that's the toughest thing around.\\n\\nStrong recommendation to anyone who loves action games, and especially if you crave the cyberpunk or Hotline Miami aesthetic.\"},\n",

The plot of this game is very slow-burning, however it still managed to captivate me and make me interested in the characters and the events of the game. I\\'m not going to talk much more of the story in this review as it\\'s best experienced blind in my opinion\\n\\nThe game itself is fairly short, only taking me around 5 or 6 hours to reach the ending.\\n\\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\\nThe gameplay is where this game is at it\\'s best. With a mix of classic Ninja Gaiden hacking and slashing, and the quick one-shot-one-kill gameplay of Hotline Miami, it\\'s a great blend of planning out your moves and executing them with perfect precision. Gladly however, the mechanic in this game that allows Zero to slow down time briefly on a cool-down, rectifies needing to be pixel perfect with more time to perform some of the harder combos of attacks. The differentiating enemies you fight throughout the game are great, and each one brings something new to the table and makes you have to think of a strategy to work around their strengths and weaknesses.\\n\\n[h1] Art [/h1]\\nKatana Zero has some really beautiful pixel art, with some simple and effective, yet very expressive character sprites. The animations are simply amazing, watching an enemy\\'s body keel over after i slash it really gives it more [i] oomph, [/i] and helps with visual response. All of these aspects fit well with the stunning backdrops and help make New Mecca feel alive.\\n\\n[h1] Music [/h1] \\nI\\'d confidently say that buying this game is worth it for the OST alone. With a retro-electro soundtrack similar to other Devolver games like My Friend Pedro and the Hotline Miami series, it\\'s very good at setting the tone for the levels, and suits the fast-paced hacking and slashing. I really can\\'t find a track in this OST I don\\'t like.\\n\\nTL;DR:\\n[b] Personal Pros [/b]\\n- Captivating setting and plot, great characters \\n- Gameplay that is a frenzy of blood, bullets and breakneck speed\\n- Jawdropping pixel art and animation\\n- Funky retro-electro soundtrack\\n\\n[b] Personal cons [/b]\\n- none, go play it'},\n",

The ability to slow down time can also make certain difficult stages incredibly forgiving, yet it fits into gameplay so seamlessly, that you never quite feel like you\\'re cheating when you utilize this optional feature.\\nThere\\'s about 4 hours of gameplay in Katana Zero, which is honestly decent, considering the quality and price of this game. What bummed me out however, is how the plot [spoiler]ends on a cliffhanger[/spoiler]. Good on the developer though, for leaving all of us wanting more.\\n\\nKatana Zero is stylish; probably the most stylish action-platformer I\\'ve ever played. In fact, it wouldn\\'t be a stretch to call this a near-masterpiece. If you are a fan of metroidvania/action platformers, Katana Zero is a [u]must have[/u].'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': 'So this is a game I got for my birthday from one of my friends. I initially put this on my wishlist just because \"eh it looks cool, the aesthetic is pretty nice\", then I got gifted the game and decided to give it a play. At first, I was kind of \"eh\" about it, felt a little janky at first. For the first 10 minutes that is.\\n\\nViolence. Speed. Momentum.\\n\\nThis game is definitely on my personal top 3 even though it could take you about 3 hours to beat the entire thing. And I\\'m aware, as of right now when I\\'m writing this review, I only have like 11 hours on this game, that\\'s plenty to make a point for me. Already I have beaten this game three times, and I would never mind going for a fourth, fith, or thirtieth.\\nThe game play just feels so smooth, so fluid, just so natural that it\\'s like a drug you can\\'t quit. You can almost feel the time around you slow as you progress through the levels, slaughtering everything in your path. It\\'s almost like those replays you had never existed to begin with and there was only the end product of what you were able to accomplish, completing the level.\\nIf you don\\'t care for the story that much, you will MOST DEFINITELY care for the game play. There is so much detail, so much diversity in such simple levels. So many different ideas that aren\\'t reused, but used very well, effectively. Everything feels unique in this game, like there is a purpose to everything you find and see, nothing feels left out, everything is used.\\nAlso forgot to add, putting this edit in- the music. I cannot stress how good the music is, and I\\'ll be 100% honest, I do not care for the soundtracks that come with small games like this, like FTL or hotline miami? Don\\'t care for it, honestly, and I\\'m sorry, I just don\\'t care. It\\'s not that I don\\'t like it, it\\'s just I really don\\'t care. This soundtrack though? By itself, I honestly wouldn\\'t care for it, with this game? It\\'s FLAWLESS. It fits so well, it feels like your katana controls the beat, the flow of the song, and the momentum of how fast it goes, or how slow it goes. My favorite track though, it\\'s gotta be the Dragon\\'s track. It\\'s just a beat, that\\'s all it is, but it just fits so well, you can FEEL the overbearing power that the Dragon has, how strong he is, how quick he is, how VIOLENT he is.\\n10/10, absolute masterpiece and I CANNOT wait for the DLC follow up of chapter 2.'},\n",

I\\'m just gonna pull off my usual review style here and put out pros and cons.\\n\\nPros:\\n[b]+ Great Visuals.[/b] Oh dear lord. Neo-Noir style is hard to mess up, so here we are with this masterpiece of pixel graphics with amazing visual effects. From flashy fighting to your casual background Blue-Pink Neon\\'ish style. Nothing cuts your eye.\\n[b]+ Action. ACTION! MORE ACTION! [/b]  This is one hell of an action rogue-like experience. Fast-paced small levels, micro-timed fighting scenes with such variation in how you\\'re able to complete the level, whether it\\'s throwing a bottle of cutting someone in flashy slow-mo off a wall while doing a backflip. Yeah... maybe a bit overexaggerated. Keeping up with the [b] ACTION [/b] on the screen might be a bit hard for a rookie, but if you\\'re familiar with Hotline Miami series, this is a darn blast game for you!\\n[b]+ Replay-ability [/b]. Now. I wouldn\\'t call this a \"New Game+\" thing. Rather just the amazing amount of story background you can get. Everything counts, from your patience, to your choices. Stealth or Genocide. Life or Death. Good boy cosplayer or a \"F### you\" killer.\\n[b]+ Soundtrack [/b]. Yes, Hotline Miami notes in every track. Feel so good and pumped up. Pleasing concert to anyone\\'s ears.\\n[b]+ This is worth your money.[/b] 15$ Is a fair price for this game. Trust me.\\n\\nUPDATE 31.05.2019!!!\\n[b]+ Yesterday this got updated with new SPEEDRUN and HARDCORE modes, I couldn\\'t simply walk past this update and not point out how much it brings to the game. I can predict some frame perfect speedruns [spoiler](because that\\'s possible due to ability to disable \"unpredictabilty\" of the game, where all enemies and bosses have exactly same patterns every time)[/spoiler]. Hardcore mode brings new enemies and faster thinking AI. Also have fun going speedrunning with your slowmotion ability off!!\\n\\nCons:\\n[b]- Something still feels off. Maybe because they still haven\\'t told us the whole story behind it... there\\'s something hinting on second part. *Wink* [/b]\\n\\n===================================================\\nSo to sum up.

You never notice one without the other. The game plays off your senses.\\n\\nCombat - Game feels solid, hack and slash how you want it to be. I find myself feeling like every now and then my slow motion was triggering, but this game is so fast paced you forget about it really quickly\\n\\nGameplay - The game handled nicely, the only few issues I ran into was when going down a level, I struggle with that in many platformers though, so I doubt it's a real issue. I found the final boss significantly more infuriating than 'fun'. Understandably the game is not about fun. But I found myself having no clue who I was fighting, as names came and went so quickly. The boss seemed hard just because she was insanely overpowered. Which puts a level of difficulty into the game that sort of just hit you like a wall. \\n\\nStory - Story was very fluid, I like how you could make a choice midway through, and whichever choice you made, you could still continue with the other choice is you wanted to. \\n\\nCharacters - They were well rounded, each with their own personality just through how they talked and the texts were highlighted, you could really tell what type of person you were facing, just through a few pixels.

       "  'Review Content': \"I'm not much of a platform hack and slash fan but I enjoyed Katana Zero a lot. The rewind mechanic alone makes for an interesting gameplay element (the fights are less stressful but at the same time it's a bit of a challenge to do things perfect). To elaborate on that: one hit and you are dead in this game. But you can always restart the current scene over again until you managed to get things right. You can also slow down time in critical situations to deflect bullets and similar.\\n\\nHowever, I mostly enjoyed the story and beautiful retro graphics. Without revealing too much it's pretty tense with a couple of interesting plot twists. Your dialogue choice also feel like they actually matter. At least sometimes they definitely are. Kata Zero does a very good job here.\\n\\nIn total it took me 6 hours to complete the game. Afterwards you can still do speed runs (there's a new game+ mode for that) or replay the story and try to do things differently. Out of curiosity, to unlock the secret end game boss or simply for achievement hunting. Truth be told, I'm satisfied with just having finished the game.\\n\\nI tend to rate games on how much I paid for them in relation to how long I played them. The ratio isn't very good here but there's games that just deserve a special place. And Katana Zero is one of them. Hopefully they'll make a sequel one day.\"},\n",

Go play it![/b]\\n\\n\\nI====.======___I\\nThis game is fantastic, Go play it!\\n[b]> Oh okay, Let\\'s see how I think of this game. Katana Zero...[/b]\\n\\n\\nGameplay-wise. It\\'s a 2D fast-paced action game focusing on close-combat. You die in one hit and also kill non-bosses enemies in one or a few hit(s). But the main mechanic of this game make you respawn right at the beginning of each short sections after you die, so you can retry the fight again and again without nuisances of long trek while also encourage trial and error gameplay. The game also give you power similar to \"bullet time\" and make use of slash attack to deflect enemies bullet with almost \"split-second\" precision (very satisfying if you succeed deflecting without bullet time). \\n\\nMission Stages in this game are divided into short sections. Each sections let you approach obstacles in different ways and also let you see your \"replay\" after finishing a section so you can relish the moment you pull off those stylish action moves again (or...like me... those funny \"Oh wait! I survive!?\" moment). Using controller, the control is very responsive and fluid, making spot on performance!\\n\\nWhile the gameplay is superb for the most part, there are some problem with this game. The stealth section of one section could be frustrating more than challenging for some especially those who wish to make a perfect stealth run of that stage because it require so much pixel perfect reaction time at the end of the last section (I retried this section even more times than when fighting end boss). Also while this game promote using various methods but at the endgame ([spoiler]yes that elevator level[/spoiler]) it narrow down your method into 1-2 constricted ways. While this is cool by it\\'s own I still think if the game let player acquire a new power or a new creative environmental interaction it would make that section more interesting and memorable.\\n\\nStory-wise. I like how this game make the protagonist power tied into the story and even played with by dialogue choices. This interesting take on dialogue choices helps setting tone and pacing of the game eventhough most of them seem like purely cosmetics. In between those heated, intense, brutal action gameplay there are some cooldown time with you roleplaying as Leon the Profe--- [i](Oh let rewind that) [/i]--- roleplaying as... herbal tea drinker with seemingly \"normal\" neighbours. \\n\\nWhile there are some good \"mind screw\" and deconstruction of videogame tropes here and there. There are also some cliches and some plot devices that feel disconnected I wish they will connect the dot for us in the sequel...yes this game is a sequel hook but it still has one big reveal at the end.  [spoiler]In which I think ...kind of predictable[/spoiler]\\n\\nVisual design is great for the genres and somewhat well-detailed (like blood splashes on the wall depend on how you kill enemies). Sound is okay... Music did it\\'s job. I really like peaceful and melancholy piano piece called \"Rain on Brick\" the most.\\n\\n[b]Overall, you won\\'t be disappointed if you buy this game for action-packed with considerable amount of challenging gameplay for a main course and let the story and dialogue choices be side-dishes.[/b]'},\n",

I have done basically everything i could possibly do with this game including speedrunning the game (for a relatively competitive time), modding the game and basically any challenge run you could think of. I\\'ve done this over about 500 hours across 3 different platforms and i enjoyed pretty much all of it because of the extreme depth in the mechanics.\\n\\nIn the story department the game is [i] not [/i] perfect. People will swear by this game saying things like \"it\\'s the best story I\\'ve ever seen in a video game\" or \"the characters in this story made me cry, it\\'s so beautiful\". However if you are in any way a fan of well thought out intricate stories then this game is not for you. The game sets up SO MANY plot devices and plot threads and resolves almost none of them. The world is so large and has so many details however almost none of them are explained. This isn\\'t just your average \"it\\'s up to interpretation story\" because i actually like those as they give you the information you need to solve the answers to questions yourself. This game is different because it is LITERALLY unfinished by design. The game is getting a free DLC that was announced way back when the game first released that should (apparently) answer some questions left by the main game. The ONLY reason this is a positive review is because 1) the speedrunning community is great and helped me enjoy the game way more than i did on my first playthrough, and 2) the promised DLC. If it were not for these two things then the story would be unforgivable for me because it\\'s almost as if it\\'s just 6 hours of setting up for another few hours of crazy conclusions to everything, that just finishes out of nowhere.\\n\\nIt\\'s a real shame because they have something so perfect with the gameplay, i can only hope that they dont fuck it up with an unfinished story. This reveiw will be updated after the dlc drops (likely soon now but i also said that two years ago so who knows), if the story isn\\'t fixed by then it will probably be a negative one.'},\n",

They're working on a free DLC that will continue the story, so don't let the shortness of the game scare you away.\\n\\nThe gameplay is very satisfying:\\n--The time slowing ability was implemented pretty well and is useful throughout your first play through, but you can also get through without using it.\\n--The post-game challenges are actually pretty touch. Hard mode and the Gold Medal achievement will satisfy anyone who wasn't challenged by the base game, and the Speedrun mode is pretty versatile in the amount of options it gives you.\\n--The feeling of slicing through bad guys, deflecting bullets, slashing down doors, and nailing enemies with throwable is very satisfying, but if you dislike the slight freeze when killing someone, you can turn it off, which was useful for the Gold Medal achievement.\\n\\nThe story mode was fun and interesting:\\n--Personally, when I can tell that the developers and writers put love into their project, it's very easy for me to get attached to characters and be interested in the story. The game is very goofy (often, bad guys will be conversing before you make your presence known, and the conversations you have with the different characters in cutscenes can be fun), but the darker undertones keep you grounded in the severity of your situation.\\n--The game's secret boss (I won't talk about it for obvious reasons) opens up a lot of questions, and it was also one of the hardest challenges in the game, especially in hard mode.\\n\\nThe game overall was just a fun experience albeit being short (100% achievements in around 20 hours isn't very long for a game). The length is honestly one of my only complaints, but I'm not stressing it because the devs are going to continue adding to the game. The ending and the secrets did a good job of making me want more, and I can definitely see why this game has an Overwhelmingly Positive rating.\"},\n",

Most rooms require you to evaluate the situation and find the correct plan of action, and then execute that plan of action with decent window in-between each action. Choosing which enemy to kill first, which barrels to shoot, whether or not you should stealth a section, the game has plenty of variety in approaching situations and its amazing. Some of the situations do offer quite a bit of challenge, especially the boss fights.\\n\\nThat\\'s just the gameplay though, the small segments in-between each killing floor really flesh this game out even further. The dialogue options you are given when speaking with the \"therapist\", the small talk you can make with the receptionist, it\\'s not necessary at all but the fact that it\\'s there elevates the series tremendously. The story is also fantastic, with you questioning \"What the fuck is going on?\" quite often. I got very invested in the story and I eagerly await the DLC. \\n\\nThe 2D art style is also fantastic. The blood and gore in the scenes look great. My only detractor from the game would be that the stealth sections are kind of a drag if you choose that route. Dying requires you to keep doing them over again and waiting, but you do always have the option of going weapons loud. It\\'s just you\\'ll have to deal with the potential story consequences later.\\n\\n[b] I would HEAVILY recommend that everyone pick-up this indie classic!

I'm only a couple hours in and I'm loving the story and decision making during conversations. The restarting is very quick and necessary, I found that turning off the rewind sfx helped with the constant rewinds as I figure out the best way to clear a room. When you get the right sequence down boy is it satisfying. So please take this as an early review, I haven't finished this game or seen all it has to offer but I picked it up on sale and it's been worth every penny so far. Art style and animation is great for a pixel based game, one of the nicest I've seen. Music is very fitting of the mood. Controls aren't just tight, they feel intuitive and simple to get the hang of. Mastering this and timing your attacks are where your skills will come into play and some cool tricks can be pulled off with some practice or you could take a more stealthy route instead. I can see myself playing through several times to see what effects my decisions and play style make. All in all a very enjoyable game so far.\\nEdited to add: \\nI've finished the game now and have seen all Katana Zero has to offer until the next update, yet I continue to play because I know I can do better on each stage. I'm 42 years old, been playing games since 1981. I play using an arcade stick because it works so well for me compared to controller. This is in my top 20 games of all time. Buy it.\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': 'In this game you play as Zero from Megaman as he lives in a world only for Reploids and that\\'s why he\\'s in his bathrobe. Zero is tasked by Megaman to kill a bunch of people including John \"El Barbón\" Rose and Daft Punk. He does this by throwing statues at them, even though he has a katana.\\n\\nA sudden guest appearance by V from Vendetta changed everything for Zero. Now I\\'ve never played Vendetta before in my life, but I\\'m assuming this game is just being lore accurate when they made V really creepy, like stalking Zero everywhere and forcing him to do unsolicited home video reviews. Thankfully he was put to his place by Zero, but he was also rescued by a random indoor blizzard. It\\'s respectably topical, but I believe if they\\'re going to bring climate change into this game, they\\'d do well to expand it a bit more. Maybe in the DLC.\\n\\nAnyway, the protagonist Megaman from Zero isn\\'t quite done yet with V so he went to Silent Hill and befriended an exploding robot in a minecart race so he can throw a statue at him. This does not work, so he hopped on a bike until V stopped having hands in being a creep. It was a rough day in general for Megaman, but it turns out it wasn\\'t over yet because THEN another dude sent his own video for reviews. At this point Megaman began to consider a full profession shift, but after a really deep and introspective scene full of imageries and symbolisms, Miamiman decided he\\'d rather kill people than be a movie critic.\\n\\nBut also it turns out, Megaman Zero had sucked in his job and his boss is really mad, so his boss gave him one final job or else he will be turned into former-Reploid. Now Zeroman had to play children\\'s card games (he was really good at it) and set himself on fire in an elevator to truly prove that he was the best in the business. In doing so though only more questions came over to his mind: If he was really good at children\\'s card games... why is he a cosplayer? Stuff like this is what makes Katanaman truly the Michaelangelo of our time; you have a man torn between what he is (bathrobe), what people expect of him (video review), and what he really, truly is (card game for children). He was torn all the way to the end of the game, with trippy scenes symbolizing his inner struggles, culminating in his confrontation against Signas who shoots needles out of his Mega Buster.\\n\\nIn an unexpected twist by the end you can also unlock the Mastery Sword, revealing the game to be a part of the Legend of Zelda franchise. This is why the title of the game has the name of its protagonist: Zelda. In short, Katana Zelda is a really good game, and I fully recommend it to anyone else who likes Akira Kurosawa classics, such as Samurai Champloo.\\n\\nPS: John Wick is in this game but he\\'s blonde with a katana and goes by \"Fifteen\". He still has his signature suit though, and he goes around seeking revenge and shooting dog videos or something idk I didn\\'t play Katana Zero.\\n\\n0/15 Best Katana Jack I ever played.'},\n",

This game I was a little skeptical of given the praise it received and the general style it was going for.  All of that said, it\\'s actually really good.\\nThe story has that hyper violent hotline miami feel, the stage progression even feels a little bit like it.  You have the after mission apartment scene, you have to perfect one floor at a time, and you have an unreliable nararator.  That said the formula works.\\nAfter you complete a room surviving, you get to see what \"everyone\" else saw while you were slowing down and rewinding time.  That mechanic reminded me of super time force ultra.  \\nThe game has dialogue trees which are interesting and fun.  I don\\'t believe they change anything long term but it changes \"who\" your character is by who you make them behave as and it makes certain events more relevant than others.\\nFor the controls they are tight and the game feels super easy at first but very quickly you find yourself clearing out rooms that seem impossible at first with like 10 guys with shotguns in them and a guy with a minigun and when you see the replay you feel a sense of joy knowing you overcome it.\\nThe game feels like it took inspiration from many different games but it also innovates sufficiently and has what I think is a really cool and somewhat twisted story.  I thoroughly enjoyed the game and have to recommend it.\\nEdit: I have to amend what I said, quite a few details change given how you complete missions and in one stage the narrative is quite different if you dodge cameras.

It is so dynamic, so sometimes there is no time to think, and you need to trust your reflexes, but when you die many times, you will get used to it, so there is no problem. The duration of the game is not long, and it is the best choice for this game because the map design of the game may bore after many hours, so they chose the correct duration for this game. Even though the map design was good on the first look, it is the same when you die or restart the game. That is why it may bore the players. Secondly, I was curious about the story which made my experience better. Also, you can see the effects of the choices during the game, so it is not the first time in-game history, but good.

STORY is really intriguing as you progress, putting our protagonist through numerous circumstances, and [spoiler]playing it while it's being recorded through a VCR[/spoiler] alongside having progressive character development, you feel more connected with the story[spoiler] turning our protagonist from a cold-hearted hitman to a parental figure.[/spoiler] Although this game has a lot of recognition already, I feel like it still deserves more.

He takes assignments during the day and returns to his rundown apartment building in a less than desirable part of town at night. Every day he visits his psychiatrist to talk through his experiences and get a dose of a mysterious drug that allows him to manipulate time (something that has pivotal story and combat implications). The prologue is simple and gets you familiar with the combat system. It starts off as your formuala one hit kill which makes you want to play smart. It quite steadily evolves into more with the addition of the Chronos mechanic. Though it starts out fairly straightforward, the story takes several turns quickly. The writing here is sharp, and the narrative runs the gauntlet of emotions from thrilling to comforting to horrifying all in the game’s short three to five-hour runtime..'},\n",

They only add unnecessary waiting imo and it kills the pace of an otherwise perfectly paced game for a bit. Is it worth $15? Ehhh maybe. The game is admittedly very short and it goes on sale often, but the gameplay is super fun and it's very replayable if you're the kind of person who likes perfecting their runs. I'd say you're fine buying it for $15 it's pretty worth not to mention there's an upcoming content update (free DLC and god I wish we didn't normalize the existence of DLC by replacing content updates with that word).

But i can honestly say that i havent had such an amazing gaming experience in a while. Beautiful art design, amazing music and outstanding story telling. The controls are tight and the gameplay is really fun. \\n\\nThe game is a mix between platformer and hack\\'n slay. You dont have a health bar and one hit will result in an instant death. But the twist is that you can, in a way, control time. And that can lead to some really ludicrous combos and in my opinion mostly fun gameplay. \"Mostly\" because levels with a larger size can sometimes become very challenging and made me feel frustrated at times. Especially since the game can sometimes demand perfect timing.\\n\\nOther than that i had a really great time. The story is rather short with about 4-5 hours. But that didnt really bother me at all. Because these 5 hours i was at the edge of my seat the entire time. Thanks to the amazing story telling, story itself, music and art. \\n\\nThe performance was perfect which is probably no surprise but worth mentioning. And the price tag with 12,49€ is in my opionion more than fair. \\n\\nTo wrap this up: \\nKatana ZERO was a very unique and fantastic game experience. It almost felt like art at times.

Kendisi aynı zamanda bizim hafızamızı kazanmamıza yardım ediyor.

The player is playing a samurai-looking character, who I’ll just refer to as “The Samurai” to avoid any major discussion of the plot points. The Samurai can plan out his attacks on each level. The goal is to kill all the enemies and progress to the next stage. The key to this is that enemies will follow the same paths given the same stimulus, and the player also gets a small ability to slow down time.\\n\\nEnemies are dangerous, as The Samurai is given no life meter, and a single mistake will spell his death, but because it’s only a “planning scenario” in his mind, he can attempt multiple run-throughs of the same level. Once a working plan is in place, the game then shows the character completing the level in black and white footage, likely done to imply it’s a recording.\\n\\nAs a concept this sounds novel and fresh; in practice, it’s less so. While the concept does give a thematic way to explain why the player can die multiple times without actually dying or having some fake construct such as “lives”, it’s done more for the story’s sake as a way to explain a few scenes later. The replay of your actions though is the bigger problem as it seems like it’s a way for the game to extend its run time in the worst way. The few replays I watched had me saying “That’s exactly what I did less than a minute ago, what’s the point?” Again this is done for a single-story scene far later, and while the replay is skippable, it doesn’t add much to the experience.\\n\\nThe gameplay of the “planning session” is excellent though. The controls are extremely tight, the combat is fast, and the player feels like he’s both powerful at times, such as being able to deflect bullets back at enemies who shoot at him, and powerless, such as when an enemy shoots a shotgun with multiple pellets.\\n\\nThe core gameplay loop is fast, where The Samurai has to keep on his toes to be sure to dodge attacks, deliver fatal blows, and more, and since everything dies in one hit, players can tear through enemies always aware the one misstep will restart the level.\\n\\nThe first few levels are run of the mill but by the end of the game, there are enough tricks, traps, and different enemies that each level will be both challenging and interesting to travel through. The only level I found to be lacking was a stealth level that worked but required a few techniques the game didn’t teach directly.\\n\\nThe same is true for the story. While the first third or half of the story is relatively ordinary at times, it introduces the player to major elements of the game, it’s about a third of the way through the game, where the story seems to buck the trend and enter into a deeply disturbing and suspenseful thriller. Once the story picks up, the entire experience of Katana Zero comes alive.\\n\\nI’ll forgo a major analysis of the story because it should be experienced from scratch, and after watching the full game, the first third of the game makes sense as it sets up the character’s world. But the story also has a big issue.\\n\\nThe game has its major crescendo in the final level and feels like there’s perhaps one final level to tie up loose ends. However, that’s not to be. Instead, the game ends on not one but two massive cliffhangers, leading players to a “To be continued” screen.\\n\\nThe issue is this doesn’t feel like a complete story. While a game like the original God of War was set up to be a trilogy, or at least have a sequel, God of War itself contained a full story that had a beginning, middle, and end. Katana Zero doesn’t contain a full ending, or rather it has all the pieces for it, but the story leaves enough major parts of its ending opening that it becomes unsatisfying.\\n\\nOf course, while looking back at the first four or five levels from the story aspect makes sense, it’s also about a third of the game where the player may become uninterested. With the game only hitting its stride after that section, it takes the player a couple of hours to get the major feeling of the experience. Up to that point, it’s a relatively average platformer, with enemies that won’t challenge the player too much.\\n\\nOnce the player can get past the opening section, Katana Zero will knock them off their feet with the visuals, story, and music. The gameplay is tight that there are a few sections in the final levels that were a pure joy to play. Katana Zero does get extremely good and ends on a very strong note, it takes a good amount of the four to six-hour run time to get there, and has trouble nailing the landing after those final moments.\\n\\nI ultimate give Katana Zero an arbitrary\\n\\n7/10\\n\\nI look forward to a future DLC and likely sequel, but I also think there could have been a move to tell the full story in a single title, rather than releasing what feels like 80 percent of the full tale in one game.\\n\\nIf you enjoyed this and want to see more from me, you can check out my youtube channel at\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/KinglinkReviews'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': '[i]If you liked Hotline Miami, you\\'ll love this.[/i]\\nLike the Hotline Miami games, Katana Zero shares the same instant-death mechanics and has a similar aesthetic. Both have an amazing synthwave soundtrack that perfectly synchronizes with the onscreen art and action. However, where Katana Zero stands out is how it implements the death mechanics into the story line and gameplay. Rather than serving as a gameplay mechanic, the story revolves around your character\\'s ability to seemingly control time. \\n\\nThe story, due to how it handles this mechanic, is bizarre and scattered and it is left to the player to piece together through the dialogue and environment. Do not underestimate the dialogue system either, smashing continue will result in you insulting the characters as you essentially throw away the story to save a few meaningless minutes. A broad synopsis would be this: You are a warrior for hire, and your employer tasks you to kill various workers and as a reward for a successful job, you are given your \"medicine\". However, as you continue you regain past memories you begin to uncover that there is much more going on behind the scenes.\\n\\nTo summarize everything:\\n[list]\\n[*]The art style and synthwave soundtrack blend perfectly with the gameplay\\n[*]Characters are colorful, easy to get attached to, and they too are tied to the death-mechanics.\\n[*]Story is fantastic and weird and may take a more than a single playthrough before you can really start to figure out what is going on\\n[*]Instant-death mechanics encourage many, many deaths until you get it right, and will require paitence.\\n[*]Your choices matter with a branching dialogue system that will keep track of the dialogue you\\'ve skipped\\n[/list]'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"[i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/35145066/] Feel free to follow my review page![/url][/i]\\n\\n[h1]The gist of it:[/h1]\\nKatana ZERO is sadly an underwhelming experience, a 2D action game with combat similar to Hotline Miami due to the instant death mechanic but with a sword-wielding main character and a story that will probably continue in future sequels, offering nothing truly interesting. \\n\\n👍 [u]The good parts:[/u]\\n-A decent soundtrack that pumps you up during combat. \\n-The story is interesting enough. \\n-Gameplay can be hard at times but ultimately fun.\\n\\n👎[u]The bad parts:[/u]\\n-While the story is interesting, it is riddled with plot holes, feels incomplete and it expects us to wait for a sequel in a 4-hour indie game.\\n-The art style and overall locations are generally not that interesting to look at. \\n-Too short.\\n \\n[h1]Story[/h1]\\nKatana ZERO's story is a messed up mystery that bit by bit it unfolds up until the end. It does keep things interesting and makes you guess but sadly once it ends it just leaves things up in the air, ultimately leaving us unsatisfied with its conclusion. \\n\\nGenerally, I'm glad when a good game gets a sequel however the way the story is presented in Katana ZERO, it pretty much feels cut in half. For an indie game that's a no-no in my books, especially for a 3-4 hour game. The only redeeming quality is that the story feels rather cool and intriguing and I do want to learn what the hell the whole deal is with the main character and his background. \\n\\nStory rating: 7/10\\n\\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\\nThe gameplay is fun, no doubt about it, and it can get frustrating in some occasions however it is nothing special. It keeps the game entertaining until the end but I wish they would've made things more complex with the levels or combat design.\\n\\nAs it is, it's a fun instant death hack and slash with some cool boss fights, a game that does not try to impress you but rather wants you to simply enjoy it. Once you get the hang of it, things get easier even if the game puts you in tough spots and by the end of it you're just breezing through it like it's nothing. \\n\\nGameplay rating:  7.5/10\\n\\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\\nMy main expectation when I bought the game was the soundtrack. Since you can clearly see some similarities with Hotline Miami and the way the protagonists puts on his music player before the level, I honestly was expecting some amazing synth-like songs only to be disappointed. \\n\\nThe songs are not bad, they're actually good enough but nowhere near my level of hype, but I guess that's my fault. \\n\\nThere is no voice acting in the game and the sound effects are pretty much average.\\n\\nAudio rating:  7.5/10\\n\\n[h1]Graphics, performance and tech analysis[/h1]\\nThe game runs perfectly as expected from a 2D pixel game and there were no major or minor bugs to encounter.\\n\\nThe art style and overall atmosphere/level design are left to be desired. I never once stopped to admire the pixelated backgrounds or the levels themselves. They never truly shine, unfortunately. At best they're okay. \\n\\nGraphics, performance and tech analysis score: 7/10\\n\\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\\nHonestly, I was expecting something more, maybe it's my own fault for getting hyped for something similar to Hotline Miami and while Katana ZERO certainly isn't a bad game at all, it really isn't that special and the only interesting thing going for it, sadly is unfinished and cut in half. I suppose you should wait for the sequel if they ever decide to make one and then get both, else you'll just start and finish an incomplete experience. The price is at least low so that's a good thing. \\n\\n[h1]Final score: 7.25/10[/h1]\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': '[b][u]This game was reviewed using Version 1.0.5. Your experience on other versions may vary.[/u][/b]\\n\\n[h3][b][u]Short Answer:[/u][/b][/h3] A fast-paced action platformer dripping with style and quality at (almost) every turn. The gameplay, art direction, and soundtrack are all stellar; and the only sore spot for me is the fact that its otherwise captivating story is, as of writing this, incomplete (but may be resolved with the promised free DLC). An absolute blast to play, and getting a resolution to the story would likely cement it as one of my all-time favorites.\\n\\n[b][u]NOTE[/u]: Players with photosensitive epilepsy will probably need to skip this one due to rapid flashing imagery and intense visual effects, which might be too much even after disabling all relevant graphical settings.[/b]\\n\\n[h3][b][u]Long Answer:[/u][/b][/h3] [i]Katana ZERO[/i] is an action platformer where you play as a swordsman with the power of precognition, able to foresee possible futures and determine the path to survival in even the deadliest encounters. He works as a killer for hire for a secret organization with equally secret motives, but his newest string of missions will force him to question everything he thought he knew--but to say anything beyond that would do the story, and you, a disservice. I\\'ll be blunt and say that I had a lot of fun with this game; and were it not for one glaring flaw--one that may be resolved in the not-too-distant future--I would probably consider this one of my favorite games in recent years.\\n\\nGameplay consists of a bit of platforming and a lot of fast-paced hack-and-slash combat, where a single hit from an enemy will kill you and send you back to the start of the level. Your only weapon is a katana that you can swing in all directions, but you\\'ve got a few other tricks up your sleeve as well: you can throw small objects to kill enemies, dodge roll through obstacles, deflect bullets with your blade, and even slow down time to pull off tricky stunts more easily. [b]It\\'s a game that expects you to die often[/b], even setting up traps to force trial and error on occasion; [b]but it\\'s relatively frustration-free despite that[/b]. Individual level segments are small and everything moves at a brisk pace, so dying never costs you more than maybe 60 seconds of progress at most. It also ties nicely into the story: the gameplay segments are framed as being visions from your character\\'s future sight and don\\'t actually go into effect until you\\'ve successfully cleared the level, making death feel less like a failure state and more like an extension of the narrative. It doesn\\'t sound like much, but stuff like this can go a long way towards reducing stress even when the gameplay is at its toughest. As someone who can get easily frustrated with games at times, I can only count one or two sections where I felt even mildly annoyed despite dying a few hundred times in my playthrough.\\n\\nThis doesn\\'t have much to do with the normal gameplay, but I want to briefly mention the unique dialogue system, because it took me by surprise in a very good way. You have the ability to pick one of several dialogue choices whenever you enter a conversation, and these choices can change depending on how fast you choose to respond. Waiting until someone finishes their block of text will give you the standard responses, but interjecting early lets you pick a more direct or aggressive response that can change the direction of the whole conversation or even end it prematurely. This system is even used [spoiler]as a puzzle mechanic in the mid-game, and you can unlock some hidden achievements and late-game content depending on the choices you make[/spoiler]. It might not be that big of a deal for most players, but I thought it was really cool and deserved some recognition.\\n\\nThe solid gameplay loop alone might\\'ve been enough for me to recommend, but they went ahead and knocked it out of the park in nearly every other aspect of its design as well. [b]The visuals are just fantastic[/b], making the most of its pixel art style with detailed environments, gorgeous color palettes, great use of shading, and surprisingly fluid animations. Everything is full of visual flair, even down to the text boxes and their range of effects and animations that emphasize the tone of a conversation so nothing is left to the imagination. [b]The music is also great[/b], and it\\'s actually the thing that first put the game on my radar. It features a lot of techno music straight out of an \\'80s-inspired cyberpunk/outrun playlist, while sprinkling in some jazz and atmospheric electronic tracks to punctuate the calm moments that break up the action. On both fronts, it\\'s some of the best of its kind.\\n\\nContinuing the theme, [b]the story matches the same high quality as everything else...for the most part[/b]. It was interesting, full of twists and turns, and managed to utilize--and sometimes even manipulate--every other element I\\'ve mentioned previously to tell a story that I don\\'t think could ever be told through anything other than a video game. With all that said, there is one big thing going against it, one that I could understand being a dealbreaker for some players: [b]as of writing this, the story is incomplete[/b]. It ends on a cliffhanger, without resolving the bulk of its biggest plot threads, leaving behind only a \"To Be Continued\" since it originally launched four years ago. Now, they [i]have[/i] been working on free DLC that\\'s said to be over half the size of the base game, so presumably we\\'ll get our conclusion from that whenever it finally comes out. Until then, be warned that your playthrough may end on a low note as you experience the same \"Wait, is that it?\" moment that I did.\\n\\n[b]You can beat the game in 4-5 hours, but doing so offers multiple opportunities to extend your playtime if you\\'re looking for more[/b]: hard mode, speedrun mode, a bunch of easily missed hidden achievements to unlock, and even an April Fool\\'s update that completely rewrites the story (details on accessing that [url=https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/460950/view/6660301466800760588]here[/url]). It\\'s stylish, it\\'s exhilerating, it\\'s an absolute treat to the eyes and ears, and most important of all, it\\'s just downright fun to play. [b][u]Although I was disappointed by the story\\'s unfinished state, the quality of the rest of the experience is just high enough that [i]Katana ZERO[/i] still gets a thumbs up from me--and if the future DLC wraps the story up right, it\\'ll become one of my easiest recommendations to date.[/u][/b]\\n\\n[quote]For more game reviews, check out my [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42524563/]Curator page[/url]![/quote]'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': 'There are a lot of comparisons of this game to Hotline Miami, and it is for good reason. I would say that this game took everything I liked about Hotline Miami and dialed it up to 10. The primitive-looking (but charming) character sprites are replaced by really beautiful, well-animated characters. The action can be just as frantic, although the time-slowing mechanic in Katana ZERO is very welcome and makes you feel even cooler when you deflect an enemy\\'s bullets back at them. The story is just as mysterious, but a lot more coherent. Maybe for some this is a bad thing... but I like being able to tell what\\'s going on in a game without reading a wiki. The music in both games is great and I\\'m not sure I could say which I like better, but that\\'s a big compliment to both games anyway.\\n\\nOverall, this is a really, really solid action game. I wouldn\\'t recommend getting it if other \"hard\" action games haven\\'t been your thing before. There is definitely a gameplay loop of dying a few times when you first feel out a level, improve, and then conquer it. I wouldn\\'t say there\\'s any level that feels unfair, but you will definitely die a lot, so if that kind of thing hurts your ego, be careful with this one! What I really enjoy about the levels is that many of them are designed for you to have multiple pathways or ways to take out the enemy. You can just kick down a door and go in swinging your sword, or you can break into an upper area, collect weapons, and get the drop on them from above.Even the bosses have sort of a free-flowing style to them. As long as you can dodge their attacks and find an opening, odds are there are multiple ways to beat them.\\n\\nWithout saying a ton about the story, it got a lot darker than I was expecting, and the themes it talked about/how it explains the protagonist\\'s powers were all very interesting to follow. I also initially disliked the dialogue system when I first saw it, but it grew on me, and ended up being really effective at encouraging players to pay attention to dialogue instead of mashing the space bar to skip through everything.\\n\\nIf I had any main criticism of the game right now, it would be that, yeah, it is pretty short. However, after reading up on it, I understand that the developers are going to add more chapters/content as free DLC, so there\\'s that. Very good, too, because the story as I wrote this review ends on a pretty disappointing cliffhanger! As long as future updates finish this story with THIS game and it\\'s not put into a sequel or anything, I don\\'t see why this game doesn\\'t deserve its recommendation from me.\\n\\n'},\n",

Story is very solid, it's intriguing and mysterious, clearly a lot of inspiration from Hotline Miami but i think this game has much better writing. The writing in this game is very witty and playful with it's dialogue options that keep you entertained during the story portions. The game does a good job of keeping you on edge by trying to mess around with the structure because of the drug the main character is using throughout the game. The gameplay is personally just ok though which is why i struggle with giving the game a higher score. It does a decent job of trying to mix things up mission to mission so it doesn't get too repetitive but i never found the gameplay to have that hook or that satisfying loop and drive like Hotline Miami does.

That's Katana Zero in a nutshell. Developed by Askiisoft, this 2D side-scrolling action adventure thrusts you into the shoes of Zero, an amnesiac samurai with a deadly task and a unique ability to manipulate time thanks to a mind-bending drug.\\n\\nAs Zero, you gracefully dodge, slice, and deflect through stages, feeling like a true sword-wielding badass. Bullet time becomes your trusty companion, allowing you to orchestrate cinematic carnage with style. While the gameplay is solid, it does have its limitations. The combat, while polished, can feel a bit restrained due to a limited variety of enemies and environments.\\n\\nBut here's where it gets interesting. The game's repetitive nature isn't a flaw, it's a feature. You'll replay encounters multiple times to perfect your moves, fitting right into the theme of mastery through defeat. There's something oddly satisfying about nailing that scenario after a dozen attempts, but it can also start to feel a bit predictable.\\n\\nThe story adds layers to this repetition. Zero is no typical hero; he's a loner with a tragic reliance on Chronos, the time-altering drug. It's a double-edged sword – it grants power but exacts a heavy price. The story deftly explores the choices he faces: endless violence or a plunge into oblivion.\\n\\nInteractive moments and dialogue choices give you some control over Zero's journey. These segments, while not drastically affecting the main plot, deepen your connection with him and his struggles. The narrative unfolds against a backdrop of dark, meticulously animated scenes that blend seamlessly with the gameplay.\\n\\nThe game's atmosphere oozes neon-lit grit, with pulsating music enhancing both action-packed sequences and story-driven dialogues. Sure, Katana Zero can be a bit grim at times, and the gameplay variety isn't groundbreaking, but it still manages to captivate. The game's unique style and sincere storytelling make it stand out even in its cynical and sometimes ugly world.\\n\\nSo, if you're up for a dose of samurai action with a twist of time manipulation and a side of introspection, Katana Zero could be your next gaming adventure!\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"[h1] A masterpiece in samurai action game [/h1]\\n\\nKatana Zero is an excellent fast-paced hack'n'slash platform game. The pixel art is charming and its good sci-fi narrative fights with the excellent gameplay for being the best part of the game.\\n\\n This is a game that shines a lot during its story and allows the player to choose some lines during the game.[b] I recommend staying away from spoilers[/b]. Briefly, the game starts from the premise that the protagonist does not remember the past and currently works assassinating targets for his employer.\\n\\n The game has simple mechanics to learn but difficult to master, as your weapon is just a katana you are limited to killing your enemies quickly and short, being able to dodge rolling bullets or hitting them during their trajectory. The game's gimmick comes from the main ability to slow down time, allowing you to escape or even kill your enemies at crucial moments. Another factor is that failing is part of the game, progress is retained until you eliminate all enemies at once, and if you die you can start over from the beginning of the area and try again in another way.\\n\\n The game has a great replay factor, encouraging discovering secrets in the levels, finishing them faster and even increasing the difficulty with new enemies and unpredictable routes. The narrative also gains a lot from this, letting you experience several dialogues in different ways to explore the protagonist's story and the world in which he lives.\\n\"},\n",

It\\'s really simple: you have your katana, you can pick up object to throw at your enemies and you have one life. If you get hit, [i]you\\'ll have to re-do the whole section[/i].  \\nIt\\'s easier than one might think, actually; in fact I struggled only in some specific segments, but for the most part it\\'s been [i]mildly challenging[/i], but never frustrating. That is, of course, for the normal mode. I can\\'t speak for the hard mode, but it has the potential to be [b]sweaty[/b].\\n\\nThe overall combat flow is [b]nice[/b]. You can dodge and briefly slow down time, allowing you to [i]counterattack[/i] your enemies\\' bullets or melee hits. It doesn\\'t get simpler than that, but it surely does bring up interesting situations, given that there are a few different enemy types, each one made to let you really get strategic at times. \\n\\nOh, and there are [i]throwable objects[/i]. Can\\'t say much about those. You have knives, bottles and special items such as flamethrowers and sticky detonators. You can get creative with that, too. \\n\\nLevel design is [b]solid[/b]. Each \"room\" has its own well-thought areas where you can set up different strategies. \\nThere were some easter eggs here and there, such as the [i]Quiet Hills[/i] floor on one of the levels: you\\'re into this frenetic ninja action and, all of a sudden, you find yourself with Pyramid Head in front of you. Your mind says \"crap.\", but then you realize it\\'s just a prop and you proceed. I found it funny. [i]Like that robot, for example[/i]. \\n\\n[h3]An interesting twist on storytelling[/h3]\\nWhile I find Katana Zero\\'s story to be pretty simple (but interesting nonetheless), I think that its major strength is in its [b]storytelling[/b]. \\nHaving your plot revolving around \"time\" basically gives you different approaches to choose from. And I think Askiisoft definitely have thought about this. Especially from half into the game.\\n\\nWhat\\'s interesting about these indie titles is that they show that you don\\'t need an extended lore to tell a story. It\\'s just what it is, and sometimes [i]it\\'s enough[/i]. Now, I can\\'t 100% say that it\\'s self-explanatory, given that [spoiler]there\\'ll be another chapter[/spoiler], but everything I saw for me was enough to come to my own conclusions.\\n\\nWhile I\\'m praising this game for how well they manage to narrate things, I can\\'t say I\\'m not a little [i]saturated[/i] from these cyberpunk games. \\n\\nI mean, not that I don\\'t like what I see. It\\'s just that sometimes, these type of games with this settings and environments tend to get a little [b]repetitive[/b]. I don\\'t mean that in a bad way, but there are always pretty much the same ideas when it comes to cyberpunk: evil corp, cyber stuff, redemption, war and all of that. I think that Katana Zero sometimes struggles to feel original and fresh, while still staying really solid in terms of animations and structure. \\n\\nCombine that with the \"Hotline Miami\" level style and the OSTs, which remind me too much of compositions from the latter, and you\\'ve got yourself a really good game with really good ideas always getting to the same conclusions as other games.\\n\\nTake [b]Red Strings Club[/b], for example. There are always those aspects, but the gameplay feels different and unique, while telling a cyberpunk story (which can be summed up as evil corp etc). \\n\\nI didn\\'t mean to rant on this, but [i]you get the point[/i]. There are strong elements here that stand out, though. For example, dialogues are highlighted in a way that makes its characters feel alive and real. I could understand what they were saying really well; I did relate with them and their feelings. So there\\'s that.\\n\\n[h3]Then... what to do?[/h3]\\nI [b]recommend[/b] this for sure: it\\'s a well made game and it has entertained me, and I think it\\'ll entertain you too. It\\'s just that, sometimes, I wish something more interesting story-wise and not so much focus on the cyberpunk aesthetic, which should only be a setting, not the main protagonist.\\n\\nMore reviews:\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/bodolovsello/recommended/'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': 'I [b]love[/b] this game to the point that I\\'m sad there isn\\'t more like it. I want more Askiisoft! BUT take your time in making it so it releases as well made as this.\\n\\nStory:\\nI won\\'t real anything but the story will reveal itself slowly over the 11 chapters and is a big part of the game to the point that if you only play games for the gameplay there is a chance you might not like the game too much I believe also to add to that, Katana Zero has 2 endings. Anyhow the game is rather short and as such the story isn\\'t finish yet so everyone that finishes it is still waiting for the Part 2. The game takes place in a mix of cyberpunk with some sprinkles of dystopian city and the character you play is a veteran that fights mercilessly. I\\'m not really telling you much of anything related to the story here but it\\'s good trust me... please..\\n\\nGameplay:\\nGameplay is fast and can get rather intense depending on how you play. The gameplay has no RNG element so people who play this game eventually develop quite skillful methods of killing enemies. The game only has 11 levels so it can be finished rather quickly but normally it won\\'t be finished [i]THAT[/i] fast. You only notice how fast you can finish the game when you speedrun it for the first time. The game also has about 4 bosses, 1 \"boss\"(more like a boss room) and 1 hidden boss. The one fault there would be in Katana Zero is that it\\'s not something you want to play with a keyboard if you\\'re going to try and get the speedrun achievement. The moving keys is a tad bit clunky seeing as to drop down a platform you need to press DOWN however pressing DOWN and another key that makes you move LEFT or RIGHT will lead you to rolling instead of just dropping down. While it is possible to get the speedrun achievement with keyboard, I would recommend that you use a controller instead if you don\\'t want to struggle as much. The thing I love the most about the game is how I make progress in an area even if I keep on dying. You won\\'t die the same way each time because each time you\\'ll learn a little bit more (You\\'ll be dodge rolling a lot to get the speedrun achievement btw).\\n\\nArt:\\nThe art is quite amazing for pixel graphics and what I mean isn\\'t that pixel graphics is normally only decent or bad but that the artist really went out of his/her way to get in a lot of detail in everything. It makes me wish I was good enough to create something like that. Pixel graphics should always have a place in the game industry and Katana Zero shows why.\\n\\nMusic:\\nMusic is aaaaamaaazzziiinnnggggggg and each area has it\\'s own song including that bosses have their own as well. I went into the game like any other expecting to like 1 or 2 songs but I ended up loving most of the songs in the game, even the  hardbass ones I\\'m normally not a fan off.\\n\\nOverall:\\nAn honestly top-notch game that\\'s completely worth getting, it does have it shares of faults control wise but the good outweigh the bad to an extreme amount in this game however I still have to warn everyone that if you want to play Katana Zero, you don\\'t want to just play it for the gameplay, you have to be someone that also enjoy the story side of the game and well... use a controller if you don\\'t want to suffer as much in speedrunning. Tip on hardcore mode and maybe also on speedrunning (is a slight spoiler) [spoiler] I recommend using the Sword of Masters because it basically has an infinite amount of projectiles you can shoot with only a short CD you need to wait for.[/spoiler]\\n\\nWelp you got this far in my first review so the curse is on you now. You\\'ll have a good day now even if you don\\'t want to.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': 'Holy shit, what a great game!\\n\\u2028\\u2028Katana Zero is amazing in all aspects: gameplay, story, art, replayability, and soundtrack. And to keep this review short, I’ll summarize what all those elements make the game incredible, unique, and something that stands out from all other indie games.\\u2028\\u2028\\n\\nTHE GAMEPLAY:\\u2028\\u2028\\n\\nThe gameplay is very simple: One slash of your sword kills your enemy, and one bullet kills you instantly. This mechanic is enough to make the game not entirely hard, but rather challenging. The idea is to always keep your eyes open, slashing your enemies one at a time. If you’re not too confident about your reflexes, that’s not a problem, because the game also has a slow-mo feature! It’s extremely useful to deflect bullets and gives you enough time to make you plan your moves!\\u2028\\u2028\\n\\nTHE STORY (SPOILERS-FREE):\\n\\n\\u2028\\u2028The story takes place in the Third District of New Mecca, where the main character, Zero, resides. Zero is a professional assassin who looks for answers about his past, while receiving some sort of treatment from his psychiatrist. As the story progresses, a few questions are answered, and more questions keep showing up on the player’s mind, trying to tie each and every element of the story together. By the time I’m writing this review, there’s already a free DLC around the corner to cover probably all the questions a player can have while playing Katana Zero.\\u2028\\u2028\\n\\nTHE ART:\\u2028\\u2028\\n\\nIt doesn’t matter if you’re not a big fan of pixelated games or not, you have to believe me when I say the art of Katana Zero is impressive. The game is very colourful, and each level has so many details, it’s honestly jaw-dropping! The lighting effects are also super awesome to notice.\\u2028\\u2028\\n\\nREPLAYABILITY:\\n\\n\\u2028\\u2028I have to be honest: by the time I’m writing this, I have 21.3 hours in this game, and that’s not only because I’ve played the story mode several times. Once you complete the game, you’ll unlock the speedrun mode, which is the main reason I’ve spent so much time in this game. If you’re an aspiring speed runner like me, I strongly recommend you to enjoy the experience of the game first, and then challenge yourself by getting platinum medal on the speedrun mode!\\n\\nSOUNDTRACK:\\n\\nIt only takes two EDM artists to make Katana Zero so stylish: LudoWic and Bill Kiley. Without any personal exception, all songs are awesome and perfectly fits the atmosphere of each scene in the game.\\u2028\\u2028\\n\\nCONCLUSION:\\n\\n\\u2028\\u2028Katana Zero may be a short game. Seriously, you can actually beat it in one hour. But everything that’s been mentioned here is a summary of all I actually wanted to talk about this game, and by personal experience, this game is one of my favourite indie games ever. If you’re a player who’s looking for good gameplay, with some varieties, Katana Zero is for you. If you’re a player who appreciates a good story, Katana Zero is for you, if you’re a player who loves pixel art… well, you get the idea.\\n\\n\\u2028\\u2028\\u2028I give this game a 4.7 out of 5 rating. Once I get to play the Free DLC, I’ll give it a 5 out 5 rating.\\u2028\\u2028\\n\\nSee you in a next review!'},\n",

Use your incredibly sharp blade, stealth, insane reflexes and time manipulation to slaughter your targets and all who stand before you.\\n\\nYour enemies will die in a single hit, that hit feels nice and weighty, and they go down with a glorious spray of blood as the impact sends them flying across the room, which all makes taking them down feel wonderful. But you also go down in one hit, so you better watch out! Dying in a section means you have to repeat it entirely, but they're each pretty short (even the longest can be completed in a few minutes I think), so it generally feels manageable, even for those sections with parts you just can't get right. Regular gameplay is a frantic loop of making your way through a stage, as you take care not to get hit, dispose of your enemies quickly, mess up that one part ever so slightly, then die, restart and do it all again until you get it right, and it is wonderful. You also have the ability to slow down time to make trickier maneuvers easier to pull off.\\n\\nThe art is nice, it's pixel-y with a lot of interesting effects thrown in, and has something of a retro cyberpunk aesthetic to it. The music does a great job of setting the mood for your killing sprees. The story is also really interesting, far above what I would have expected, and is certain to impress you, horrify you, leave you asking questions, and also sadly leave you feeling unfulfilled in some respects, as some threads aren't fully explored by the game's end.\\n\\nIt's an amazing game overall, would highly recommend it to anyone fond of 2D action games.\"},\n",

Possibly the best use of electronica in a video game that I have personally experienced till date. Love it Love it Love it.\\n\\nWhat complements the rhythm is the inventive action in this game in form of platforming levels encasing set piece enemies - you basically bring a sword to a gun fight and its fun AF. The depiction of action with its bullet time, pace and blood splatter is a work of art and there is real heart put into creating the environments. The pixel art of this game itself is a great sell - loved the disco level especially btw.\\n\\nThe story too is intriguing enough for you to keep powering through the fun and punishing orgy of sword and bullets as you play the role of a contracted special ops (kinda) soldier working for a powerful organization (government?) carrying out hit-jobs. As you do so, the story drip feeds you with meaty plot development and you discover more about your grim past and your present association with the drug Chronos. Oh and there is also a sweet 5 year old girl that befriends you.\\n\\nCertain set piece battles are more tough than others but there is adequate challenge to be had in the game. With the music and artwork put together into the action, I'd highlight that there is a flow to this game that really makes this an amazingly enjoyable experience. There really needs to be many more games like this.\\n\\nPlay this game today, don't wait for the sale. You want this. You need this. It's a damn near perfect video game.\\n\\n9/10\"},\n",

With an engaging and smart dialogue system built around people skipping dialogue is genius. This game is a masterpiece and my third favorite game of 2019. This is a must play for anyone that likes great games.\"},\n",

That being said  where do I start with this... the graphics are stunning, the game play is fluent and makes you use your imagination at times, the game just makes you feel like a total bad ass. The story is phenomenal and always had me guessing (in a good way!) and it all just tied together so nicely. All that being said however, I have three issues with the game. Number 1, the story left A LOT of unanswered questions. I won\\'t list any here but it made me guessing for more and because the story was so intriguing and so interesting that it just left me wanting more, so maybe it was that. Number 2, the occasional bug that was a make or break in some levels. Don\\'t get me wrong the game is incredibly polished but in my entirety of playing the game I experienced around 8 game breaking bugs that made me feel horrible. To name a few, I clipped through the ceiling and had to restart the level when only one enemy remained. I heard the \"bullet reflect clank\" noise but the bullet didn\\'t reflect and I ended up getting shot. And lastly, the game not deciding when I can and can\\'t roll. The last and final problem I have is that the sequel can not come any sooner :), make it any dollar amount and I\\'ll pay it man, haven\\'t had this much fun since hotline miami 2.'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"After being engrossed by Katana Zero for the entire past week I've found myself begging for more with each decapitated enemy. This game is nothing but the finest combination of artful story-telling, great stylish graphics, fast-paced fair action and just seriously one of the best games to sink your teeth into over the weekend. The only complaint I'd have is that the story is left a bit open (with free DLC coming soon which will hopefully wrap it up), but don't let that detract you from purchasing this experience and robbing yourself from the chance to finally feel like John Wick - if only he was wielding a sword instead of a gun.\\n\\nAt first I had some reservations about the overall playtime with story being only about 4 hours long, but after realising that hard mode is not just the same levels with inflated hit points I've found another 4 hours of enjoyment from that part as well. While hard mode is satisfying by itself, the best feeling is coming back to the normal game and feeling like a proper Katana-wielding god of death slashing fools like there is no tomorrow, the game presents yet another challenge to you via the form of a speed run. I've always found speedrunning interesting, but never really had the time or dedication needed to truly devote myself to a particular game, but Katana Zero has successfully lulled me into completing the Gold Medal achievement which requires you to beat the game under 30 minutes. After some Googling and about 6 more hours, I've managed to do it - all thanks to the masterful difficulty progression that was so meticulously put together by the developers.\\n\\nTruly, if you have any love for action platformers and want an experience that keeps offering more in new and inventive ways, look no further. This is a diffcult, yet rewarding, game, which definitely gives back all that the player is willing to invest. It is easily one of the top games to have come out this year and I can't keep my mittens to myself asking for more!\\n\\n10/10 proper masterpiece\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': 'Holy sh*t dude, Katana ZERO. I was half-expecting the game to be yet another overhyped indie that I wouldn\\'t really jive with, but this game honestly gets the praise it deserves. \\n\\nOne would be quick to compare the game to Hotline Miami, but I think Katana ZERO is far more visceral and aggressive than Hotline. The defensive options that the player has can be used to further augment an aggressive push-oriented playstyle. The dodge roll can not only be used to dodge bullets, but it can be used to move closer to the enemy or just to reduce the delay between slashes. Not to mention you can reflect bullets with a well timed slice. It just feels so right when you get a good spree going. Even though there is some items you can toss, combat is most often up close and personal.\\n\\nThe game is fairly difficult at times, since you can die just as easily as you can kill. The game gives you the ability to slow down time to try and think more about your next move, but I find myself using it as a panic button more often than not. Since the game is a bit strict on getting good timing down, having the ability to slow the pace to the player\\'s will can help out, but I think I would have preferred something a little different. There was a different indie game I played years ago called Gunpoint that had this feature where if you died, you had the option to rewind 1 to 5 seconds before you died, so you can instantly try to redo the dumb thing you did in hopes that it would work if you did it better. I would\\'ve liked a feature like that in Katana ZERO, since dying means you have to restart a part in the level, and some parts in some levels take a really long time to do. You could argue that this reduces the consequences and tension to dying, but I\\'d argue that having this feature would keep the momentum of aggression flowing by being able to instantly try again the moment you screw up. Mistakes could still be punished if you, say, limit the amount of times you can go back a few seconds before restarting.\\n\\nThe stealth sections in this game, as cool as they are on paper, don\\'t really fit with the design of the game. I suppose they do fit with the thematics and story, but they slow the pace of the game down to a literal crawl. Even though they are optional, I had the impression that you had to stealth in order to get better results. I think the main problem with the stealth is that it would work in a game where you\\'re more vulnerable, and you\\'re not some killing machine. The moments the game tells you specifically not to kill bad guys kinda frustrates me with my compliance, all because I\\'m lead to believe that I might have to just sneak on by.\\n\\nThe story of the game is surprisingly compelling for a game all about assassinating targets. There\\'s slow moments where you\\'re just lounging around your place, drinking herbal tea and watching the latest news of some supposed \"Dragon\". Then you\\'re talking to your psychiatrist who prescribes you with time drugs. The dialogue and the world feels real for its setting, and the writing is evidently on point. Granted, you wouldn\\'t play a game like this just for its story, but it is cool to have that. It makes the game more memorable overall.\\n\\nThe soundtrack, and to an extension, the aesthetics of the game follow the trend of returning to the roots of the 80s. You got the VHS style rewinding and those classic synths. For me, that sort of thing is starting to wain on me due to overexposure, but I can still admire it for what it is. I especially love the settings screen that\\'s just blue and while like back then. You even continue where you left off by loading VHS tapes into a TV. Having said all that, the soundtrack just feels serviceable at the least. I\\'ve never felt like at one point that the OSTs really added to the experience, but maybe I\\'m just biased and would really love to kill to some Carpenter Brut blasting loudly. I think where the soundtrack is best is for those chill moments when you\\'re not killing. They really make you feel all cozy inside. I can say the same for the game\\'s entire sprite work and sound design. Everything feels like it has terrific impact and weight to it; everything just fits perfectly.\\n\\nAt the time of writing this, I haven\\'t beaten the game yet, but I feel like I\\'m already half-way through it. For the experiences I\\'ve had with the game though, it is well worth the price. I\\'ve been coming home from work at my crummy job always thinking \"I can\\'t wait to get back and play Katana ZERO\" and these days I\\'ve hardly had that feeling. I\\'ve never played a game this damn good in a long time, and with recent updates involving hard mode and speedrunning, I am ever so eager to see what lies in store for the rest of the game, and whatever it might offer in the future.\\n\\nEDIT: I beat Katana ZERO twice and I am confident to say that I have seen all there is to the game in its current state. This game is probably the best game I have had the chance to play this summer. I\\'d also like to mention that the soundtrack has grown on me a bit.'},\n",

I sat through it in one session of never stopping gameplay, always getting a little bit better and better. Dying never felt so satisfying for me. It's really quick gameplay which is kinda forgiving, because of the ability to slow down time.  The story was, at least for me, really great to enjoy watching/playing and had some points where it really mattered. The level of violence shown in the game is similar to Hotline Miami, which is not a problem for me but might be a problem when a younger person is playing this game.

Самые душевные игры делаются не напоказ, они скрыты в глубинах, и их надо найти.\\n\\nЧто есть в Katana ZERO, что может заинтересовать? Да, здесь нет бомбезной 3D-графики и трассировки лучей. Здесь всё в большинстве пиксельное, но абсолютно не важно. У игры есть своя шикарная атмосфера, которая поддерживается достаточно качественной пиксельной графикой и очень проработанными анимациями.\\n\\nКазалось бы - обычный платформер с механикой замедления времени. Не совсем. Сюжет игры и его подача довольно интересны. Пройдя игру и подумав надо всем этим, я ещё раз понял, насколько ценна жизнь, и насколько страшна смерть. Всё это подкреплено отличной музыкой, которая остаётся в сердце вместе со всей историей этого мира. Более того, звуковые эффекты в диалогах и разноцветный шрифт помогает полностью понять интонацию, с которой говорит тот или иной персонаж.\\n\\nТяжело рассказать, насколько эта игра хороша, и при этом не проспойлерить сюжет. Я просто порекомендую её к прохождению.\\n\\nОдно я точно скажу - перфекционистам в спидран вход запрещён, но хардмод стоит попробовать.\\n\\nА так - ждём продолжения.'},\n",

The OST is very nice and atmospheric, in some moments very intense, but usually with a pretty laid back vibe.

       "  'Review Content': \"Framing is an oft-overlooked element of game design. Sure, you can slap bullet time or save points into your game without explanation, but making them part of the narrative can provide unparalleled immersion for even the most outlandish titles. That’s what makes games like Katana ZERO such rare joys, the fact that every single element of the presentation is tied to the narrative and mechanics. From your time-bending powers all the way to the VCR you select stages on, this intense, bloody journey builds layers of meaning and intrigue around a single, compelling core: getting through this neo-noir hell with as much style as possible.\\n\\nIn the rain-slicked streets of a grim neon city you arrive, clad in but a bathrobe and armed with only cold Japanese steel. The voice on the other end of your phone wants you to kill everyone in the strange factory you find yourself at, a simple task once you start slowing down time to the point where you can deflect bullets with a sword. Room by room you expunge all life almost effortlessly, painting the walls with blood from an impossibly quick blade. When your task is done you return to your hovel of an apartment, your nightmares, your appointment with that voice on the phone, your neighbors, your demons, your rivals, your doubts, your fears, and the truth.\\n\\nTo say anything more would be to spoil one of the most intense and twisting narratives you’re ever going to get from a platformer, one that I’m going to be mulling over for days if not weeks. Your hobo samurai has a lot of people interested in his mysterious combat prowess, while at the same time you get to play through vignettes of his life as an attempted citizen. There’s often more drama in these little glimpses of city life than in the machinations of war and government he’s caught in, thanks to some excellent writing and world-building. Just the way factions from the war are mentioned, or districts of the city, or famous figures is enough to make the setting pop in a way that few games can.\\n\\nMore than this, though, is how the brilliant dialog system puts you right in the center of the story. It’s one of those where your responses are on a timer, and you must make your dialog choice before time runs out. However, most choices also give you a tiny window at the start where you can interrupt the person speaking. Interruptions can lead to wildly different paths through the dialog, and sometimes affect gameplay beyond that. And it’s all done in lavishly colored animated text that floats over the speakers, highlighting key terms for emphasis and shattering on interruptions. Just when you think you’ve seen everything Katana ZERO does with this mechanic, I assure you it will find a way to surprise you.\\n\\nThat’s really the beauty of this one across all its features, that it will never stop surprising you. Every mechanic and detail will eventually get used in a way you didn’t see coming, and that happens most frequently in the action itself. As a godlike samurai assassin, you have only your sword and your reflexes to dispatch goons, swordsmen, armed security, and worse. But you can slow down time to perfect your moves, roll past deadly attacks, reflect bullets with your blade, and sling objects like bottles and vases to neutralize distant threats. Each room must be perfected before you can move on, like little bite-sized Hotline Miami levels strung together in a mounting crescendo of murder.\\n\\nBut here again, Katana ZERO excels in the details. The action you are partaking in, the ritual of attempting, dying, and attempting again, is framed as the planning that your bathrobed terror does before actually executing. Once you have perfected your plan, the game replays the room for you as if on a security tape so you can witness your exploits at human speed. This is a key framing mechanic, and one that the plot centers on in a big way. And even this will defy your expectations in incredible ways, ways that make the game all the more engrossing as you battle your way through it.\\n\\nI cannot stress enough how polished every aspect of this title is, either. The pixel art is absolutely lush in its animations and special effects, making you feel ever strike of the blade and hitch of the video tape playback. The sound design matches the intensity of the action, and the soundtrack is some absolutely killer synthwave and soulful tracks that carry the neo-noir stylings to new heights. There are moments of levity, like the cosplay dialog options and Strong Terry, and moments of intense dread. There are beautiful vistas, and rooms caked in gore. It’s an incredible ride from start to finish, and I assure you that you’ll be left wanting more at the end of your 4-hour (or so) journey. Katana ZERO has a vision and it stops at nothing to express it, blending style, substance, and action into one of the most cohesive packages I’ve ever seen.\\n\\n\\n\\nDid you enjoy this review? I certainly hope so, and I certainly hope you'll check out more of them at https://goldplatedgames.com/ or on my [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/11322459/]curation page[/url]!\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"I'm on a quest to find out whether this game is better than sex.\\n\\nEDIT: Had sex, the game is better.\\n\\nEDIT 2: So here's the actual review. I won't focus on reviewing just the game, but rather focus on the area that does not get talked about enough, which is speedrunning the game (the reason why I have half a thousand hours in the game). The game is exceptionally good at speedrunning, it's both easy to pick up and extremely satisfying to continue striving for even better times. Why ? It's because the gameplay is both satisfying and hard, and it only gets more punishing as you incorporate even more challenging ways of completing each room. A few more reasons why it's great to speedrun:\\n- Barely any RNG present when speedrunning (besides the motorcycle section, but the dev promised that he will make this section RNG-less once the DLC comes out) and the RNG that is present only accounts for a few seconds of time variation, so that basically only matters at top level. As such the player's skill is the only thing that matters if you beat your personal best time or not.\\n- The run itself is mostly gameplay, there are no cutscenes that you have to sit through and waste your time (there are like 3 instances total of the player needing to wait ~10 seconds in the entirety of the run).\\n- Most rooms are challenging to speedrun, and each one have ways of improving time. There aren't many situations where once you learn the particular room it stops being challenging or it's impossible to shave off further time (exception being the final boss and autoscroller in doom, but a doom skip has been found for one of the autoscroller parts, so that's epic)\\n- The runs are short, at top level they only take 15 minutes to complete, this means that you do not have to focus for extended periods of time.\\n- The game is very easy to setup for speedrunning, you don't need to setup an external program to keep track of time, since there is an in-game timer.\\n- The dev actually listens to our requests and will change some stuff once the DLC comes out.\\n- The speedrunning scene is active, so pop into the speedrunning discord server and ask your questions.\\nSo if you're interested in speedrunning the game, check out the guides section of the game's speedrun.com page. If you have never speedran a game before, give it a try, this was my first game that I speedran and it's a blast, give yourself a challenge first of obtaining a gold medal (~30 min range speedrun), and if you found it to be fun, aim for a sub-20 min run next.\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': '[b]Katana ZERO[/b] is a highly immersive cyberpunk/neo-noir (I honestly don’t know the difference) cross between Ninja Gaiden and Hotline Miami. Albeit incomplete and short, this game oozes high quality production from start to finish; my only hope is that the continuation/future updates will manage to maintain this level of quality. I also want to mention that this genre of games usually doesn’t interest me, so this experience was a very pleasant surprise. \\nA big thank you to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/dworry]dworry[/url] for recommending this game! \\n\\n[u][b]Played with PlayStation 4 controller[/b][/u]\\n\\n[h1]✔️[u]Positive:[/u][/h1]\\n[b][+] Attention to detail in combination with creative and intelligent design choices makes Katana ZERO an incredibly immersive experience:[/b]\\n[olist]\\n[*][b]We need to talk about how extraordinary the dialogue is.[/b]\\nYes, the writing is good, but the way that dialogue was presented is what really blew me away. The developers used a myriad of animations to incorporate “voice acting” in the text boxes without the use of voices at all. By changing things such as the speed of text appearing, and animations and colour of certain words or phrases, you get a very strong indication of the tone of dialogue. \\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2163734569 \\nFurthermore, you are offered dynamic dialogue options that change during the countdown. You can choose to take your time to select your most appropriate answer, or quickly and rudely interrupt whoever is speaking (emphasized by the shattering of the text box). Naturally, your answers/actions have an impact on the direct conversation and the course of the story. Katana ZERO may not be the first to incorporate these designs but they managed to execute it masterfully. \\n\\n[*][b]Superb attention to detail.[/b] \\nThere are multiple examples of this but I will focus on the details that I found really added to the immersion:\\n\\n(a) Random entertaining NPC encounters that juxtapose the gore and other mature themes that run rampant throughout the game. [i]You can also pet a cat.[/i]\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2163733927\\n\\n(b) Mundane actions such as burning your kill contract or drinking your tea at the end of a mission have to be triggered by the player. It may seem silly but the simple act of interacting with a tea cup actually transmitted through the screen and helped me relax after the high-intensity segments. \\n\\n(c) At the start of the action sequences, Zero (main character) takes a moment to put on earphones and turn on his music cassette, which in turn cues the in-game music. As an added bonus, the music is [u]amazing[/u]. \\n[/olist]\\n\\n[b][+] Easy to learn, hard to master type gameplay with the right amount of difficulty.[/b]\\nIn short, you can move like a ninja and are equipped with the ability to slow down time, dodge roll, slash your sword and throw certain objects. The time-manipulation is certainly overpowered but is not indefinite (used up like stamina) and is counterbalanced by the fact that Zero has no health bar; every mistake is fatal and will cause you to reset the room. Each level requires a balance between good reflexes, wit, tactics and adaptability. Optional unlockable swords aside, you do not obtain any new abilities during the game but instead get better at managing your time-manipulation ability to deal with increasingly complex situations. While this is usually not my preferred type of game, the progressive difficulty made for a very enjoyable, yet challenging, experience. \\n\\n[h1]➖[u]Neutral:[/u][/h1]\\n[b][-] Compelling but incomplete story.[/b] \\nKatana ZERO does a great job at balancing high intensity encounters with appropriate down-time moments and still manages to organically merge in hints of the backstory. However, the story is currently incomplete and has left me with more questions than answers.\\n\\n[b][-] Given all the buzzing and fizzing effects, this game is indubitably the worst nightmare for people with photosensitive epilepsy.[/b] \\nIt’s clear that the developers are aware of this, since they included a warning directly upon launching the game and also the option to turn it off. Since I do not suffer from epilepsy, I chose to experience the game as intended by the developers but found that it was a little too buzz-y and fizz-y for my taste.\\n\\n[b][-] Each room has a countdown timer to encourage a high pace but there were very few instances where I felt pressured to finish the level.[/b] \\nPerhaps the developers were too generous with the time given? This may not be the case for hard mode but I don’t know from personal experience.\\n\\n[h1]❌[u]Negative:[/u][/h1]\\n[b][x] Short.[/b] \\nMy first blind playthrough took approximately ~3 hours, and then an additional ~2.5 hours to explore alternative paths and endings. Upon finishing the game, hard and speed run modes are made available but I am more interested in experiencing the rest of the story. As far as I know, the developers have promised more content, so (hopefully) there will be more to look forward to!\\n \\n[h1]🏅[u]Verdict:[/u][/h1]\\n[h1]★★★★☆ A fantastic start[/h1]\\nKatana ZERO is currently an incomplete experience but shows a lot of potential. Despite thoroughly enjoying the game in its current state, I am slightly hesitant to recommend it at this moment. However, at the same time, the game shows enough promise to justify my faith that the rest of the game will be just as good (or even better?). The satisfying gameplay and immersive story form an excellent base to what might be an exceptional gaming experience. Let’s hope for the best!\\n\\n[table]\\n[tr][th][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/26827738/]If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up and follow me on my [b]curator page[/b].[/url]\\n🇹🇭🇦🇳🇰 🇾🇴🇺 🇫🇴🇷 🇾🇴🇺🇷 🇸🇺🇵🇵🇴🇷🇹!\\n[/th][/tr]\\n[/table]'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"Where do I begin? This cult classic has slowly become my favourite game of all time. The side-scrolling slasher has been reinvented as an amalgamation of Hotline Miami and Classic Ninja Gaiden.  \\nTelling compelling narratives in video games is no easy feat. Taking a heavily story-focused approach to design typically either results in more of an interactive movie or, in trying to balance both, nails storytelling at the expense of a top-quality gameplay experience. Every now and then, though, a game manages to nail the formula in a way that never feels intrusive or unnecessary. Katana ZERO is one of those games.\\n\\nKatana ZERO is incredibly secretive with its premise, and for good reason. The player takes on the role of a young man who’s seemingly an assassin for hire. He takes assignments during the day and returns to his rundown apartment building in a less than desirable part of town at night. Every day he visits his psychiatrist to talk through his experiences and get a dose of a mysterious drug that allows him to manipulate time (something that has pivotal story and combat implications). The prologue is simple and gets you familiar with the combat system. It starts off as your formuala one hit kill which makes you want to play smart. It quite steadily evolves into more with the addition of the Chronos mechanic. Though it starts out fairly straightforward, the story takes several turns quickly. The writing here is sharp, and the narrative runs the gauntlet of emotions from thrilling to comforting to horrifying all in the game’s short five to seven-hour runtime. I dare not spoil even a bit of the deeper narrative here, but Katana ZERO’s unique dialogue system forces players to make quick decisions that directly impact how the game plays out, making it worth playing through multiple times in to try other routes. The story takes many incredible turns which will certainly confuse you (so try and pay close attention to all the dialogue.) There's very subtle but satisfying instances of foreshadowing to spot which only adds to this game's amazing replayability. With a recent update, speedrun and hard-mode have been added to compensate with the lack of content which offers a lot more to challenge yourself. \\n\\nQuite on the other end of the scale is the absolutely stellar sound design and 80s synth-pop soundtrack. The ringing sound in your ears every time you get a new dose of “medicine” never stops feeling unnerving, and even the measured use of silence is done to great effect. There’s a great mix of energetic and sombre tracks, and I came to grow rather fond of the quaint piano keys that played during the more mellow scenes. Also worth noting is that the names of songs and composers appear at the start of each mission shown on-screen as the samurai switches the track on his walkman.\\n\\nKatana ZERO is a concise, mysterious and rather sombre game. The way it tells its intimate story is engaging as some of the best thrillers out there, though whether or not the story itself lives up to the delivery is debatable. Nonetheless, this is an action game first and foremost, and to that end, it passes with flying colours. Expect to die and get frustrated a lot, but also look forward to a deep sense of satisfaction after banging your head against a particularly tough boss or enemy sequence. There’s a lot of fun to have here and, with the choices you make having a significant impact on how the narrative plays out, it pays to run through the game a second time and try other options.\\n\\nIf gameplay, audio, visuals, and story were ammo loaded into a gun, Katana ZERO is firing consecutively from each barrel. With every component supporting each other, the title feels very consistent and well rounded. Any flaws like difficulty or varying times of knockdown recovery can be overlooked in my opinion. \\n\\nMasterpiece, 10/10\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': '[h1] Katana Zero is a game about a former war veteran, who works now as an assignment killer, wearing katana and samurai outfit. The whole game is presented as a neo-noir full of neon decorations action platformer with a captivating story full of twists and turnabouts. [/h1]  \\n\\n[b] Pros: [/b]\\n\\n+ Satisfying gameplay with fast combat and lots of planning\\n+ A captivating story that is easy to follow\\n+ Protagonists\\' unique abilities \\n+ Perfect level design\\n+ Outstanding pixel art\\n+ Synthwave/retrowave soundtrack \\n\\n[b] Cons: [/b]\\n\\n- The game is exactly filled with redundant swearings and dirty talks\\n- The whole game is frustratingly short \\n\\nJust imagine that you found a game, which is a perfect mix of one your favorite genres in gaming, it\\'s filled with your type of music and its plot reminds you of all these mindblowing movies you were crazy about all the time. That\\'s exactly what happened to me while I was playing Katana Zero.\\n\\nKatana Zero combines everything that you need to have in a game, that would be called \"a true masterpiece\" when it\\' released. It\\'s like picking perfect ingredients to make a delicious meal. But what\\'s more important is that aftertaste that you feel after the meal. \\n\\nThat\\'s what Katana Zero manages to do in the best way.\\n\\n[h1] Story [/h1]\\n\\nThe story is probably the strongest part of the game and it\\'s something I don\\'t want to talk much about, simply because it\\'s so unique and mindblowing, that you have to experience it all for yourself without any spoilers. The whole story had been strongly influenced by the best representatives of the cyberpunk genre and I am pretty much sure, that every single player will see this story in their own way.\\n\\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\\n\\nThe whole game is represented as a typical \"one shot-one kill\" game. You play as a veteran of a war, dressed in a kimono, a samurai which name, the whole story, and identity remain as a secret until the end of the game. The game\\'s mechanics follow pretty much the same idea: you come to the therapist/psychologist, he asks you a few questions about your health, gives you a mysterious drug and sends you on the next mission. After your mission is done, you come back to your apartment, watch a vivid dream and then repeat. \\n\\nOne of the first game mechanics you meet in the game is the dialog options system. The player always a choice either interrupt interlocutor with a nervous response or listen to the end to have more answer options. Usually, this interruption thing leads to unpleasant consequences, while if you remain patient, you have a chance to retrieve some new information regarding the story and the game\\'s protagonist. \\n\\nWhen it comes to combat, the protagonist has the ability to plan his attacks and rewind time whenever he fails. Once you proceed with the story, the game explains everything regarding this ability and how it all works. Since it\\'s a one shot-one kill prepare to die a lot and plan as much as possible during your game. The difficulty\\'s curve of this game can be a little bit weird: you start the game and it looks pretty easy, then few levels later it becomes way more difficult, then it becomes easy again and then everything changes once again. \\n\\nIt’s important to mention that the whole combat thing is pretty fast, the player can dash, reflect enemies’ bullets, roll between the enemies, make jump walls to get to his destination point, etc. This fast-paced action always keeps you strained never giving a little chance to relax. Most of the enemies can be killed by a single hit, some of the enemies can deflect at least one hit, so they require two hits to be killed but the most annoying enemies are the ones with shields, because they force you to jump over them and outsmart them, which can be a difficult task sometimes. \\n\\nThe majority of side scrolled levels can be completed pretty quickly and easily without any attempts or retries. Every single level is divided into small stages and if the players get a bullet in his head, they have to start over from that particular stage, not the whole level. What I really enjoyed in Katana ZERO is that most of the levels can be completed in multiple ways and the player always has a choice. It can be very helpful and quite convenient if the player is stuck at a certain point and the best way is to try something else.\\n\\nAll my love goes to developers for making the game equally interesting in terms of gameplay and its story. The more you play, the more you get into the story and feel like you don’t want this game to end. They were able to find a perfect balance between the gameplay mechanics, level design, some unique levels that are different from the regular one, where you have to kill everyone and then just run away, pretty interesting and remarkable boss battles, etc. At some point, you understand that you feel a weird satisfaction dashing through enemies and quickly roaming around the levels to fulfill your contract.\\n\\nWhat I really didn’t appreciate about this game is an incredible amount of swearings and bad words all along. I never felt like it was something required for the whole game or the story itself, this game would be even better without it in my opinion, seriously it was way too much at some point. \\n\\n[h1] Graphics [/h1]\\n\\nKatana ZERO has pixel art graphics that may look pretty simple from the first glance, but once you play the game for some time, you will see that every single level, enemy and every other thing in the game is quite detailed despite its simplified style. Plus all these visual tricks with neon lights, VHS old tapes, and CCTV recording screens add some amazing charm to this game as well.\\n\\n[h1] Sound [/h1]\\n\\nAs being a huge fan of retrowave/synthwave music myself, I instantly fell in love with Katana ZERO soundtrack. The whole game is filled with Ludowic and Bill Kiley’s tracks which perfectly suit the atmosphere of the game. \\n\\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\\n\\nKatana ZERO is a great pick for someone who is in love with action fast-paced challenging games and once you are into it, you will enjoy the game to the very end. It can be a bit annoying from time to time with its frustrating levels and a ridiculous amount of enemies, but it doesn’t change the fact that you are dealing with a great and quality indie title.\\n\\n[h1] Enjoy!

       "  'Review Content': 'From the outset, Katana ZERO wears its inspirations on its sleeve. Its pulsating neon aesthetic, synth-heavy soundtrack, and hyper-violent gameplay are all familiar trappings of countless flashy titles populating the indie games space. Most are lackluster attempts to recreate the magic of 2012’s Hotline Miami, failing to build upon the groundwork laid by one of the most successful aesthetically similar titles. Katana ZERO’s dedication to presenting highly stylized and polished gameplay topped with a thought-provoking psychological storyline is what makes it a standout title of 2019.\\n\\n Katana ZERO is a neo-noir action adventure title that puts you in the robes of a mysterious samurai hitman. Tasked with eliminating targets residing within the confines of the dilapidated metropolis by a mysterious employer, the player searches for targets as well as answers to their equally mysterious past.\\n\\nKatana ZERO’s gameplay concept is fairly straightforward, however the level of mechanical polish and style makes it remarkable. Levels, such as prisons and underground science facilities, are broken down into various rooms. Each room is filled with patrolling enemies that must be eliminated before being allowed to proceed. Combat is instant death, which adds considerable weight upon every action taken. Careful planning is required before proceeding, which places even greater emphasis on a required gameplay mechanic: death. Death triggers the rewind feature which, upon dying, shows the player a replay of their last life. This feature allows for analysis of mistakes or an opportunity to study environments to discover alternate routes or strategies to employ. In a game where death comes in a split second, this tool is imperative to mastering the fundamentals of combat.\\n\\nWhile death is frequent, most encounters (boss battles aside) should only require a handful of lives before being able to surpass them. Combat is challenging due to its ever-evolving nature which forces the player to be dynamic in their problem-solving. Fortunately, the player is given the freedom to pursue creative solutions to combat, as they are never pigeonholed in a single solution. While brute forcing their way through fights is rarely viable, it always remains an option if your skills are up to the task.\\n\\nAs you are a samurai, a katana is the primary means of dispatching enemies, but you also momentarily have the handy ability to slow down time. This makes evading enemy attacks simpler and ideal for perfectly deflecting incoming projectiles back at their senders. The feeling of lethal speed of your character is both satisfying and gives combat a fluency that’s intoxicating. There are also single use projectiles such as bottles, knives, and Molotov cocktails scattered throughout environments that serve as deadly commodities best reserved for tricky combat situations. All of these abilities are essential in exploiting the weaknesses of more advanced enemies, such as shield-wielding cops or katana-parrying thugs.\\n\\nHad Katana ZERO merely been a fantastic stealth action game devoid of a meaningful story, it would still be an easy recommendation. So it also offering an expertly penned psychological neo-noir story not only elevates but compliments the entire experience. The player’s plight to uncover their traumatic past is one that begins simply enough yet quickly presents many more intriguing questions. Snippets of backstory are uncovered during therapy sessions or visits to your dilapidated apartment in-between missions. While at the time these snippets of information may be confusing, all the puzzle pieces fit into place by the end. It isn’t merely rediscovering the past, but interpreting the present. The narrative frequently challenges the player’s understanding of their realities, with the concept of an unreliable narrator being called into question in more ways than one.\\n\\nThe player does have some impact on how their story plays out through the dialogue tree. Frequently faced with dialogue options during conversation, selecting one of three options results in varying conversation paths, and will affect the outcome of some sequences.[spoiler]In one mission, a hotel receptionist questioned my samurai outfit. Instead of ignoring her, I opted to give a lengthy lie about cosplaying as an obscure anime character. At the time, this was a humorous interaction and nothing more. It wasn’t until I was leaving the hotel, covered in my recently slain target’s blood, that a police officer questioned my appearance. Just as I expected a fight to break out, the receptionist interjected explaining that I was a cosplayer and not a crazed killer. The officer bought this and allowed me to leave the lobby peacefully.[/spoiler] Moments like this make the dialogue option more than a simple extension of the narrative, as the player’s decisions can have a meaningful impact on their progression.\\n\\nThrough the entire experience, Katana ZERO exudes a familiar but pleasing aesthetic and noir tone. It’s a gritty, yet illuminated neon city filled with unsavory characters who are a reflection of the run-down metropolis. Its environments are simple in their construction, but the minor details that populate the world give it life. Whether it’s your character switching on their walkman, blasting synth heavy 80s techno before every mission, or removing his katana before sitting down, the developer’s dedication to bringing this world to life is fiercely apparent.\\n\\nMy only complaint is that there isn’t more of it. It only takes about four hours to complete, but I am already planning to return to it to discover alternate dialogue options and to bask in its terrific gameplay. It’s a game that, from the outside, skeptics could dismiss as “just another neon pixelated action game,” which the indie space certainly has an abundance of. But Katana ZERO’s almost unprecedented level of polish, lightning-fast gameplay, and thought-provoking story make it one of the year’s best indie games.'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"[h1]Hotline Miami, Gunpoint and some guy who really likes cyberpunk walk into a bar…[/h1]\\n\\nKatana Zero is a story-driven action platformer developed by Askiisoft. You play as a damaged war hero with a weak grasp on time and reality who performs assassinations for his therapist. It really does feel like a mix between Hotline Miami and Gunpoint: taking the fast pace, high stakes gameplay style from the former, and the level design from the latter. I was really surprised by how much story there is here, I was even more surprised by the fact that it’s actually the most compelling part of the game. \\n\\nNote: At the time of writing this, I have seen one possible ending for the game. I will continue to update my review as I continue to play, but it’s worth noting that this is a short game. I’ve read on the forums that it’s expected to take 4-5 hours to beat, which lines up with my own experience so far.\\n\\n[h1]Positives: [/h1]\\n[list][*]The art here is fantastic. I’m obviously a sucker for cyberpunk, but the pixel art here is really top-notch stuff. The animations are also great.\\n\\n[*]As I mentioned, this is a pretty story-heavy game. Absolutely not what I expected, but it works surprisingly well. The game is well written, and the story is really intriguing. Everything is confusing to begin with and information is revealed to you as you play through the game. \\n\\n[*]The gameplay is tight and can be incredibly fast paced. There have been time where I’ve just kind of flailed around and hoped for the best, but for the most part it remains pretty precise. You blow through levels slicing up enemies as you careen towards an assassination target. You can also slow time and throw projectiles at enemies. Apart from some boss fights, everything here goes down with one hit. \\n\\n[*]Every time you die, you get rewound to the start of the section you’re in. The game feels fair, so whenever I died, I was only frustrated with myself, which is what you really need from a game like this. Figuring out the right way to approach things, or just improve your skills, and then beating a section you found hard is very satisfying. \\n\\n[*]The levels are really well designed, and there’s definitely a noticeable increase in difficulty as you play through. There’s not a huge amount of enemy variation here, so the challenge comes from where enemies are positioned in levels, and what other kind of obstacles there are. It works well.\\n\\n[*]There’s an in-universe explanation for why you’re able to ‘die’ and retry the levels. It’s not super convincing, but I appreciated this detail, nonetheless.\\n\\n[*]The music is fantastic. [/list]\\n\\n[h1]Neutral: [/h1]\\n[list][*]There are a bunch of secret achievements here, the majority of which seem to be related to things that are easily missed while playing. If you’re an achievement hunter, there’s probably some enjoyment to be had in replaying levels to search for things, but if you’re not then I don’t think Katana Zero offers much replay value. [/list]\\n\\n[h1]Negative: [/h1]\\n[list][*]Katana Zero’s biggest problem is that the gameplay doesn’t evolve, at all. You have a sword, you can grab things to throw, and you can slow time [spoiler](later in the game, you do play as a character who has an extra ability, but it’s still not enough)[/spoiler]. All of the game’s mechanics are given to you in the first mission and then that’s it. Like I’ve said, the gameplay is really good, but I was disappointed that nothing new was introduced across the different missions.\\n\\n[*]Enemy variety isn’t great. There are two melee enemies, two ranged enemies, and then one that is a kind of combination of the two. Now, these enemies are well designed and there’s definitely good variation between them, but five enemy types for the whole game didn’t really feel like enough to me. Combine this with the lack of any gameplay evolution, and the variety in the game really takes a hit. The level design is the only thing that keeps the game fresh.\\n\\n[*]As I mentioned up at the top, there are at least two endings for the game. There’s a crossroads kind of moment where you make a choice and you either end the game there or continue playing on. I am now continuing on, but I first chose the other option. I found that ending incredibly lacklustre and really disappointing. This moment in the game is made out to be a really big deal, and if you don’t choose to carry on then it kind of just ends and there’s no resolution to the story, and I felt like there should have been. [/list]\\n\\n[h1]Verdict:[/h1]\\n\\nKatana Zero has some major issues, but that hasn’t stopped me from thoroughly enjoying it. Tight gameplay and an engaging story, what’s not to like? If you’re a big fan of Hotline Miami-likes or games with similar level design to Gunpoint and Deadbolt, I’d recommend giving it a try. But it’s probably best to wait for a sale.\\n\\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider following my curator page: [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33633486/]Kemo's Corner.[/url]\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"[h1][b]Slashing Through the Shadows…[/b][/h1]\\n» [b]Katana Zero[/b] is a blisteringly fast indie slash-em-up with action that is an absolute adrenaline rush. Taking more than a few cues from [b]Hotline Miami[/b], it is largely about a drug-addicted neo-noir-inspired samurai who sticks a bunch of needles in his body. It wears its inspirations on the sleeves of its kimono but refines the tried and true one-hit-kill formula in a manner that makes it feels fresh, exciting, and innovative in surprising ways.\\n\\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\\n» This game puts you in control of a nameless samurai assassin with the power to manipulate time and see into the future. In an extremely clever and fun framing of the action, every level is contextualized as being the planning of an assassination. So, instead of your character dying, you are told “No… That won’t work,” as your precognition rewinds to the start (complete with old-timey VCR effect), giving you a chance to find a solution that does not end in your death. Every level ends with a security camera recording of what “actually” happened, which serves not only as a way to see your moment of triumph played back but also to subvert expectations in interesting ways later on.\\n\\nWorking up to that moment is a blast because Katana Zero’s action is fast-paced and empoweringly flexible. Like Hotline Miami, it is one shot, one kill for both you and any enemy that is not a boss. Your character can slash in eight directions, slow down time, use a dodge roll to avoid bullets or reflect bullets back with his sword. There is a great flow and feel to your character’s movement thanks to small touches like how each sword swing gives you a slight boost of momentum, or how you can cancel out of any roll, and the way each kill gives a satisfying screen-shake and pause to the action.\\n\\nHowever, the most iconic feature of this platformer is the slow-mo effect – specifically, how optional it is. It never feels too strong; it is on a pretty strict cooldown, and since enemies will hear whenever gunfire rings out, you will rarely have time to stay safe long enough for it to replenish. This puts it in a perfect spot as a powerful ability to get you through a tough situation while still being limited enough to keep the action quick.\\n\\n[h1]Story[/h1]\\n» The story of Katana Zero does not quite hit the high note that its action does, but it is at least carried by strong writing and a few great characters, such as your boss/therapist that guides you through your traumatic past while also providing you with the dossiers of people he wants dead, as well as a psychotic Russian adversary named V. It unfolds in a dystopian neo-noir setting, where you are entangled in a web of conspiracies and government experiments. Exploring deep themes of trauma, identity, and the consequences of one's actions, Katana Zero poses itself as a dark and mature tale, artfully woven into the fabric of the gameplay experience.\\n\\nFor instance, there is an innovative dialogue system that allows players to choose unique options based on their timing and interjections. By rudely shutting down conversations or patiently listening, players can unlock different dialogue paths, adding entertaining depth to the game. However, while these choices provide multiple playthrough opportunities, the story deviations feel superficial, and later dialogue options can be inconsistent with previous decisions. Additionally, the game’s narrative leaves much unresolved, hinting at a potential sequel or DLC, but the lack of payoff in this first chapter may leave players feeling unsatisfied.\\n\\nWhile Katana Zero will not take more than four to six hours to complete, it is a very tight four to six hours that cuts out any fluff. It never feels like it is running out of ideas, and every level does a great job of introducing small twists to its simple formula, from an underground minecart level to a motorcycle chase sequence on the city highway.\\n\\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\\n» It also helps that everything looks and sounds great. The slick neon aesthetic and fantastic sprite work go hand in hand with some legitimately impressive 2D lighting effects that give this game a unique visual style and personality. Accompanied by a fitting and catchy retro-electro soundtrack, the audio elements perfectly complement the intense action.\\n\\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\\n» All in all, Katana Zero’s time-bending samurai action is the star of the show here, but it's unique presentation and entertaining dialogue go a long way in supporting a plot that suffers from feeling like it is saving its best ideas for a sequel. As action games go, the game’s shorter length makes it a quick fix, and I’ll no doubt suffer withdrawal while I wait for the next hit.\\n\\n[h1][b]Score: 8.7/10[/b][/h1]\\n\\n[b][i]Was this review helpful?[/i][/b]\\n» If so, please leave a rating.

I enjoyed the game very much and I'd love to see what happens next.\\n\\n[h1]Art[/h1]\\nPixel art that is well animated and engaging. Distopia future style. Extremely violent. Blood can be turned off. There plenty of the 80's Cyberpunk style.\\n\\n[h1]Story[/h1]\\nStory brings in a lot of questions and mystery to every single character. I'd say more but I feel this story needs to be experienced in the way it should be: Through dialogue text boxes. There is a timer on every piece of text and choices to be made within the time. Going through the story once, I can't tell you if choices change the outcome of things. It's engaging to choose a different response on multiple playthroughs.\\n\\nEdit: As I played a little more trying to get achievements, I learned that some answers give you different results in dialogue and give a little more depth to the conversation. Ultimately, your choices in dialogue doesn't change the main outcomes of game endings. Typically, games have a set ending no matter what you choose, simply because there is a narrative to follow or that making multiple endings is much harder to get done.\\n\\n[h1]Music[/h1]\\nTwo people created the music and they did an excellent job giving the thrill and motivation to keep going. Mostly retro synthwave with good dance beats.\\n\\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\\nThe controls seem a little, how should I say, fast but slow at the same time. It's tough to explain, but they are responsive. It's like each thing you do has a small cooldown period.\\n\\nSlash\\nJump\\nDodge Roll\\nSloMo\\nThrow Object\\n\\nYou are thrown into a 2D cross-section of stages with baddies to kill before you can move on. If you die, you have to do the entire room again. The game is super fast paced, even with the slomo gauge.\\nYou are able beat the game without slomo, but this is extremely tough, and should only be done in Speedrun Mode where the enemy spawns are not random. Yes, that's right. In Story Mode, enemies can spawn little off, turned around, moving in a different direction. This can be frustrating to those who want to get past a difficult section by learning a pattern. It can give a sort of fun challenge where it's not the same thing over and over. Things change up, so it doesn't get stale.\\nMy advice is to beat the sections purely based on light planning and reaction time.\\nYou can deflect bullets!\\n\\nAs you progress, new enemy types spring up, but interspersed with the old ones you have seen. Some have much faster reaction times than before. Careful with the muscle guys, their fist swing has a hitbox bigger than expected.\\n\\n[h1]Difficulty[/h1]\\nExpect to die many times. I'd say the game is not too tough, but not for the faint of heart. The game presents you with small sections where it doesn't feel like a unending gauntlet. You do need to think quickly and be on your toes.\\nDeaths are quick and can even be quicker when the rewind feature is turned off.\\nI did not get frustrated at this game's difficulty (Normal).\\n\\n[h1][b]I did not like being shot by enemies off screen.[/b][/h1]\\nBut you can kill people off screen too.\\n\\n\\n[h1]Stuff[/h1]\\nThe game starts you out with a small tutorial to teach you the basics of movement.\\n\\nThere are secrets, easter eggs, and other fun stuff to enjoy as you go through the story. The game is extremely interesting and wanting to have fun everywhere you go. The devs really put in a lot of thought into the games design. Take your time when there is down time.\\n\\n[h1]Small details[/h1]\\nStory Mode - has a slight randomness to enemy location, facing, movement with each respawn from death.\\nSpeedrun Mode - Unlocked after beating the game, with a bunch of nice settings for speedrunners, like removing the randomness if you don't die.\\nHard Mode - Unlocked after beating the game.\\n\\nController support for ALL major platforms - PS, Xbox, Switch, K&M, with icons and labels in their respective setup!\\nMy only tip would be to turn down the camera shake. I turned mine down to 5%. It was too much at max.\\n\\nI sort of wished there was no timer for dialogue, but at the same time the game urges you to just keep moving with your instincts.\\nIt was really fun to be able to NOT use SloMo and get past certain sections. Makes you feel super awesome not to need to slow things down.\\n\\nSpeaking of speed, take a look at the Hitpause option. This is an option where each hit done pauses the action for a fraction of second for dramatic effect. This also gives time for players to take a look around for bullets, but this can slow down and eat inputs. Turn this option down and the game will seem to go even faster and react quicker to your inputs.\\n\\nA lot of the changes in options makes it feel like you're playing a whole new game.\\n\\nI created a small guide on the extras that you hunt down. Just needs some sprucing up with images and gifs.\"},\n",

Check.[/b]\\n\\n[h1]Yes, that should work.[/h1]\\n\\nCurrently I feel ashamed of myself not playing this gem til early 2020. This is not your everyday pixel hack'n'slash adventure. Katana Zero is a phenomenal game. The way it presents itself is top-notch, the way it takes on dosing is creepily wonderful, and the way the characters develop is beyond your imagination. Plus, its pixel art is beautiful and that, is a big plus to me.\\n\\n[h1]Things I Like About Katana Zero:[/h1]\\n\\n[b]1. Combat System[/b]\\nYou are not any superhero type of guy. You only have one life, just like your enemies. Yet, your greatest advantage over them are the abilities to simulate the situation and to slow down the time. In the gameplay of Katana Zero, every combat in the level is a prediction in your head. The player has to perfectly clear the level in order to proceed. This feature makes every combat unique and a mini of its own. You may clear the level solely with your sword, or you can observe your surroundings and takes advantage of them. The ability to slow things down is your core element in the combat. If you have even a slightest hint of dying, slowing the time is your best bet. This allows you to see how the enemies will react and counter them immediately. These two ideas merge perfectly, and the execution is so satisfying that clearing a room makes you feel stylish and thrilling. Plus, you can deflect bullets back to the owner with a katana. How cool is that!?\\n\\n[b]2. Enticing BGM[/b]\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OylGrT6mK-M&list=PLWCkhGoFcFiw4wIjwIOEk6a3kE_KuHbp2&index=5&t=0s\\nEven when writing this review, I am indulging myself with [i]You Will Never Know[/i] by Bill Kiley. I must compliment the composers of this game. Those people surely know and do a great job of creating background music. In a game which hack'n'slash and good timing happen all the time, players might feel a bit tired of the gore and so many failed simulations. Here is the moment the music actually kicks in. The soundtracks are brisk and pleasant, quite the opposite comparing with the gameplay. This oddity somehow soothes the tediousness of mind, or even accelerates the efficiency of killing. I find myself think better and clearer under the light-hearted tempo the BGM offers, which often leads to faster level completion and a urge for more perfect execution. In another word, I kill faster and better with the music on, just like our protagonist. [strike]Am a psychopath?[/strike] \\n\\n[b]3. Intriguing Story[/b]\\nThe story of Katana Zero is bleak and beautiful. An ex-soldier, now assassin with a mixtape, who can simulate any possible situation in his mind and even slow time, goes on several assassinations and gradually uncover the great conspiracy behind the scene revolving around the drug he is relying on, Chronos. The farther he goes, the more shady and horrifying truth emerge from the surface. Even though the ending is a cliffhanger, the amount of characters development during the assassinations is enough to leave you breathless and you will crave for more. Not only the story is good, the way it present the story is good as well. Our protagonist is on Chronos, which often gives him hallucination and reality shifting. You never know which of which is real. Is the girl really there? Do the masked men really exist? Or is it all just the side effect of the dosing? This part of the story is open for debate, and I love to see community work out the possible whole story.\\n\\n[b]4.

In most games, you listen to the music during your time playing the game, and then you're done with it. But this game's music is different. You will likely listen to it outside of the game (It's on Spotify!). It's really good!\\n\\nGameplay is also fantastic. Lots of slashing with your katana, or use environmental objects such as guns, flamethrowers, vases, etc... There's a lot to do with so few buttons. You dodge stuff, and slash stuff. There is minimal amount of puzzles in this one. It's quite challenging so learning the ins and outs of the combat will make this experience a lot easier. It's not too hard, but mistakes are heavily punished. And ah, dialogue is pretty great, but I'll cover that during the story paragraph.\\n\\nGraphics in this game are awesome. It's pixel art stuff, but good pixel art stuff. There are reflections, neon light effects, and much more. At no point during the game I was disappointed. I have nothing bad to say about the visuals of this game.\\n\\nAnd we reach an important part of this game. It's the story. It's good. The writing is done quite well, and sometimes on the funny side.

It's done really well, and well worth going through other dialogue options besides the main one.\\n\\nKatana ZERO surpassed my expectations, and has done a fantastic job at delivering the final product.

This assassin takes kill contracts from his psychiatrist who supplies him with his daily dose of medicine. He lives in the [b]Third District[/b], a rough area of town with neighbors that are quite loud at night. When sleeping, Zero has nightmares of his past, which he discusses with his psychiatrist. That’s all I can really say about the story, there is much more to it but I want to avoid spoiling the story. \\n\\n[b]Katana Zero[/b] is a very story-heavy game, with that said it manages to bring a sense of mystery around itself after each mission. It’s like [b]Hotline Miami[/b], with all these questions that you will be asking yourself, like what’s the point in doing all of this killing? However, this is something you can change, you can choose to follow the orders given to you by the psychiatrist or not. This helps to bring some depth into the game.\\n\\nThere are also multiple dialog options that you can choose to unravel the story with. You can act nice to the people around you and play it cool or you can be aggressive to everyone around you, it’s an interesting way to interact with the environment. You can also choose to break the flow of the story in your own ways at certain points and it’s something very unique that I found very interesting, it messes with your head.\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2432225475\\n\\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\\n[b]Katana Zero[/b] has some challenging gameplay that you will have to muster your way through to progress. You can kill all the enemies in one hit, however, you can also die in one hit and if you do you will have to redo the level from the start. There are a few objects you can pick up like bottles or statues that you can use to throw at enemies to block a bullet or kill them. There is also a smoke grenade which is honestly my favorite one to use as some enemies will lose track of you to allow for some easy kills.\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2453437579\\n\\nSome missions will require you to be stealthy and this can add some more challenge to the mix on those levels. However, you can also choose to not do that and kill all the enemies on the level. This can add some different dialogue options from different characters and it can proceed the story in different ways.\\n\\nIf you feel up to the challenge, you can also go and play the game on hard mode. In this difficulty, stages will have new variants of existing enemies that will have new ways to attack. Enemies also have increased reaction time and some will shoot you much faster than before so be careful.\\n\\n[b]Zero[/b] has the ability to slow down time for at least a few seconds where he can deflect bullets or dodge certain attacks. This ability can be useful and will save you more times than you think. I should note that you can only use it for a certain amount of time before it needs to recharge. The main things that I found difficult to reflect in this mode were the shotguns and [b]Machine Gunners[/b].\\n\\n[b]Katana Zero's[/b] gameplay is very fast-paced and you will need some quick reaction time to dodge certain attacks. It will ask a lot from you so you will have to get used to what the game will throw at you in terms of difficulty. Another thing that I should mention is that the controls on the keyboard and mouse are a little weird, as the cursor is what direction [b]Zero[/b] will swing his sword at. So let’s say you have your mouse aimed upwards, [b]Zero[/b] will always do an up attack with his katana and this could lead to your death if you were not paying attention to where the cursor is located. I highly recommend using the controller as you don’t have to worry about messing up your slashes.\\n\\n[h1]Graphics and Performance[/h1]\\nI love the pixel art graphics that [b]Katana Zero[/b] has going for it with its neo-like city. Each area you visit is done beautifully and I wish I could look at some of the areas more often but the time limit prevents me from doing so. I tested the game on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, AMD Ryzen 5 1500X Quad-Core Processor 3.50, and 16 GB of RAM. There were no issues present while I was playing and this game should run on almost any computer with no problems. Also the soundtrack is really well done and I loved almost every song that was played.\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2453438798\\n\\n[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]\\nIf you enjoy 2D platformers that provide a challenging experience then I highly recommend [b]Katana Zero[/b]. It has similar things to that of [b]Hotline Miami[/b] in terms of graphics, soundtrack, gameplay, and story. The game is on the shorter side, maybe five or six hours total, so I do recommend purchasing when a sale is going on.\\n\\nThere is also a DLC that is being worked on and from what I hear it is going to be free which will add more to the story.

It is a fast, slick and technically demanding 2D action platformer that requires timing, precision and strategic thinking from the player. As shown in my total playtime, I clocked in roughly 14 hours at the time of this review. I completed the main story (which took about 4-5 hours) and hardmode (which took an additional 3-4 hours). The remaining time played was just me dabbling in speedrun mode.\\n\\nThe core gameplay is mostly centered around combat. This includes omnidirectional melee attacks, dodges via rolling, a bullet time mechanic, throwable weapons scattered around each level and various environmental hazards such as turrets and lasers. There are also different types of enemies each with their own of attacks, the gun wielding enemies being the hardest to cut down. That being said, Katana Zero subverted my expectations. I went into the game expecting a pure visceral combat experience but soon realized the game is much more than that. \\n\\nWhat makes Katana Zero so great is that it’s a game about learning. The player dies in one hit regardless of the source, whether it be from an enemy attack or an environmental hazard. Understandably this can be frustrating but at the same time it encourages us to think strategically about our next moves and learn from our previous mistakes.  How should I tackle this room? Which enemy should I hit first? What’s wrong with what I’ve been doing for the past 10 tries? This method might be quicker but it could be more risky? These are the questions I would ask myself while playing the game.\\n\\nThe combat system might look simple at the outset but it is quite nuanced and requires the player to make use of all mechanics in tandem to be an effective killing machine. Melee attacks can be used to deflect enemy bullets back towards them, which is an integral ability to learn in order to master the game. The melee attacks are also omnidirectional and provide the player with multiple ways to slash enemies from various positions. Multiple enemies can also be killed by a single attack if they all are within the attack’s range. Different throwable items carry with it different effects and might be more effective when used on specific enemies. The incentive behind using these mechanics in tandem lies with the delay between each melee attack. \\n\\nFor example let’s say you’ve got 4 enemies in a room. One enemy is a melee based enemy who parries you. The second one wields a pistol, the third an assault rifle and the fourth a shotgun. You can’t run into the room and simply slash everything to bits and pieces. You have tactically decide how to deal with each enemy using all the previously mentioned mechanics. Sure you could go in and first attack the melee enemy but chances are he’d parry you and that window of recovery might leave you open to being killed by the remaining enemies. Instead, why not dodge through the melee enemy’s attack, deflect the pistol wielding enemy’s projectile back towards him, kill the melee enemy from behind, throw the assault rifle enemy with a knife, dodge through the shotgun wielding enemy’s attack and finish him off last? All the while making use of bullet time here and there to ensure your victory? This is just a simple example of what to expect from the game and it can become much more complex during your playthrough.\\n\\nKatana Zero is a challenging but fair game. Throughout my experience, I never felt like the game was unnecessarily harsh and all my deaths were a result of my own mistakes. Enemies are hyper aggressive and will attempt to hunt you down once alerted to your presence so it is best to try and take out as many enemies as possible with the least amount of moves. The bullet time mechanic also helps make things easier but because it depletes much faster than it recharges, it’s not a get out of jail free card and is not an easily exploited mechanic. The addition of a countdown of each room also incentivizes the player to finish the room as fast as possible. Hard mode is far more challenging than the base game and mainly features more enemy placements, hazards etc .There are also a few enemies exclusive to this difficulty.\\n\\nThe story of Katana Zero was surprisingly more complex than I thought and was the main focus of the game. There are various NPCs that offer plenty of dialogue options and the story can get pretty dark. Right off the bat within the first 30 minutes of the game, a mystery revolving around the protagonist is already established and the story becomes more interesting the more we learn about his past. My major gripe with the game is the gameplay feels so good but feels like it takes a backseat to the story. The story is well written and I’m not suggesting they should have neglected it but a few more levels within each stage would have welcomed. Thankfully the developer patched in speedrun mode but this doesn’t really address the issue of a lack of levels. \\n\\nOverall Katana Zero is a great game. The gameplay is superb, the visuals gorgeous and the game boasts a stellar soundtrack. Don’t miss out on this. It’s the best indie game of the year so far for me and I recommend you buy it as soon as you can.'},\n",

And I still can\\'t stop thinking about it since then.\\n\\nKatana ZERO is a game that has essentially no flaws, at least in my opinion. We\\'ll play as Zero, dubbed \"the Dragon\" for his brutality, a man dressed as a samurai (much to the amusement of other characters) that seems to work as a hitman although not even he knows why or for who.  He just knows he has to carry out these hitman tasks, given to him through the psychiatrist that treats him, because Zero has lost most of his memories and doesn\\'t remember who he is, aside from a recurring nightmare that haunts him. What he does have, however, is the power of seeing the immediate future.\\n\\nUsing this power, he can infiltrate facilities and buildings without being seen, anticipating each of his enemies\\' movements and making a perfect plan to kill everything in sight. This way, the segments you play are actually Zero\\'s plan, and once you\\'ve managed to defeat all opponents in a level, you\\'ll see Zero redo exactly what you did (so a replay), carrying out the plan, but with no bullet-time (did I forget to mention that\\'s a thing too?). This is the way the game explains dying, which you will do, a lot. It\\'s a one hit death for everyone, both you and your enemies, so you will need some trial and error in each level to find out the best way to carry your task. This, if you ask me, is a genius way of explaining death in a video game.\\n\\nThese are the most interesting gameplay points, but definitely not the only good thing the game has to offer. The story is amazing and the way it\\'s told to you is organic and fluid, featuring some great twists, the graphics are beautiful pixel art and the animations are very carefully crafted, the characters are charismatic and well written, the dialogues are entertaining and often funny, the gameplay is super satisfying, everything is just perfect. The game also counts with enough replayability mechanics, which is nice because the game isn\\'t specially long. There are secrets to uncover, new weapons with different ranges and speeds, different paths to take and even a speedrun mode.\\n\\nThe single flaw this game has is that it\\'s not finished. The game doesn\\'t have an ending and the story cuts abruptly. However, it\\'s known that a DLC with more content is being worked on, so I\\'m not worried about that. I\\'m more than happy to wait for more of this masterpiece, one of my favourite games of all time for sure.\\n\\nBuy Katana ZERO. Please. You don\\'t know it yet, but you need it.'},\n",

They are all supposed to be free from what I heard of and they will expand more on the unfinished story. It's definitely worth buying this game tho. Alternatively you can wait for more to release but why would you do that?[/b]\\n------------------------------ [h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]\\nThe game is fast paced and really bloody. The game may sometimes be too fast and that's why there is an ability to slow down time. This allows you to easily deflect bullets or dodge past them.\\nYou don't carry any guns with you so the only long range attack you have is anything you can throw. From knives to bottles or even bust statues.\\nThere are some really underused mechanics like fighting behind a wall where you can only see silhouettes that was only used once as well as the other playable character that you also get the chance to play once. He is able to use dash that would cut all the enemies in front of him in a certain range but after he would be unable to use a sword for a few seconds.\\nWhat I really liked was the swords that you can unlock. They would offer at least some amount of replay ability by having a chance to play the levels in different ways. You can unlock them by finding collectible cards [b](1st can be found when you go left the first time you start to play)[/b]\\n------------------------------ [h1]GRAPHICS[/h1]\\nThe pixel art is so well done and it's nicely detailed which is impressive with the smooth gameplay combined. It is filled with awesome looking neon lighting and you can actually see the light on your character and on others and watch it move as you walk past the source of the light.\\nHowever, the first thing that really hits you, because of the look, is the menu itself. The levels are VHS tapes stacked on a shelf and you can also see the remote too which moves as you rewind or skip certain chapters.\\nAlso the speech bubbles are full of colorful text and they have a nice effect when you interrupt someone where the letters fall out and go off the screen.\\n------------------------------ [h1]SOUNDTRACK[/h1]\\nGreat soundtracks with [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIzZdsItsEY]*Hit the Floor*[/url] and [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj568DGRHGE]*V Limo (New Dong Shi--y)*[/url] being by far the best with [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v_RixPSnL0]*Third District*[/url] which also has some good qualities. Every level offers a unique song that plays as you slash your enemies. I really like how the character puts in his earbuds at the start of almost every level to listen to this awesome music. Tiny attention to details like this really puts this game high among others.\\n------------------------------ [h1]STORY[/h1]\\nThe story gets a little complicated and tangled as it goes but it's really not that hard to put it together. Just kill everyone that gets in your way, right? Well after a while it's not that easy as you start revealing all the lies you've been fed by and after that you slowly uncover your forgotten past.\\nApart from the main story there are nice little side stories like TV broadcasts, everytime you come back home from a mission, that talk about your doings or characters Strong Terry and Slender Richard (later named Skinny Ricky).\\nThe game also explains the reason you can keep dying but still continue to play. I love the game that can do that in such a great way.\\nYou can also choose multiple options that you can say. You can be rude or you can behave. These options can in some cases change some parts of the story that is unfortunately a little bit short.\\n\\n\\n[b]Prepare to take your medicine, kick in some hype music and play KATANA ZERO on a loop.\\n....\\nYes, that should work.[/b]\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': 'Wonderfully animated and beautifully scored, Katana ZERO pretty much exemplifies the best that gaming has to offer in its genre. The core conceit of the game revolves around what amounts to two time altering abilities, a \"bullet time\" slowdown to help the player execute maneuvers with precision, and a \"rewind\" feature for helping iterate strategies for levels until the player gets it just right. While the gameplay is fast paced and high stakes, what makes this game great is not the mechanics alone, but rather how the narrative is perfectly served by those mechanics.\\n\\nTo quote Ron Burgandy: \"Great story. Compelling and rich.\"\\n\\nBut seriously, very few games achieve such a high quality blend of story and design, and while the game can be demanding in its difficulty at points, I believe that it is accessible to anyone with perseverance, rather than some minimum reaction time.\\n\\nThe game should only take you a handful of hours to complete (I spent 7 completing all of the achievements I wanted), which makes this fairly cost effective in the price-per-hour department, and there is an upcoming free narrative DLC that should add more to the story for those who are still somewhat worried about the value of the game.\\n\\n10/10, would drink the soup again.\\n\\nEDIT: Now that the Steam Awards are here, I am adding that I have nominated this game for Game of the Year, through a combination of intense game play, outstanding audio/visuals, and a truly great narrative.

This goes for your character and the enemies as well. So, naturally, you will die a lot. But you always restart at the same screen to learn from your mistakes and tackle the action in different ways. You could say that Katana Zero is partly a high-speed platformer-action and part puzzle game. The level design is great and open so that more than one path can lead to success. There are only a handful of frustrating passages.\\n\\nTight controls, an awesome pixel art look and some of the best synthwave soundtracks around also make this a very memorable experience. The game is quite story heavy so there is a lot of downtime between the sweaty action parts.

Its fast paced and exciting to cut up a bunch of fools and not look like a clown while doing it. \\n\\nBetween missions, the story will play out with you choosing what Zero says. Sometimes, depending on what you say, certain story events will play out differently. There’s even a point where, if you’re feeling particularly glue-eating that day, you can lose your sword for the majority of the next mission. \\n\\nKatana Zero is also one of those pixelated 2D games, but it decided to play off that and dedicate to the artstyle instead of just using it as an excuse to make Atari graphics and call it the SNES. The Pixel art and backgrounds in Katana Zero are--\\nI don’t know, whats a funny way to say “really really good?” \\n\\nJuicy.\\n\\nKatana Zero’s pixel art is juicy. \\n\\nI’m not sorry. \\n\\nNew Mecca looks like a place I would actually like to visit, even though I know its a shit hole, or at least the District you’re in is. It punches all the right buttons on the “Things Dirk likes” soundboard. Beautiful twilight-lit skies, neon signs illuminating the night-time streets, long stretches of urban apartments, gives me that ~Aesthetic~ feel. \\n\\nThe soundtrack is also bopping, a nice mix of beats that keep the game going. It even has an in-universe reason to be there with Zero putting in earphones before a mission. I’m not really a music guy, so I can’t comment more on that.\\nGive me money and I can pretend to be a music guy, however. \\n\\nKatana Zero was a really fun time, I started it up and didn’t stop until I finished it six hours later. There are a bunch of achievements I missed, so I might go back to that sometime in the future. There’s more content on the way, or so I’ve been told.\\n\\nSpecial Thanks to Serc for sending me a free copy of this, he told me to review it and also called me a bad name, so I kind of had to or else he’d do it again and I’d cry. \\n\\nIts one of those indy games that actually tries, which is always admirable, especially so if the game is good.

       "  'Review Content': \"Short & sweet, but replayability is key.\\n\\nGameplay in Katana ZERO is very enjoyable, with the core mechanics of a bullet-reflecting blade & slow-time resulting in a game that's as satisfying as it is stylish. That satisfaction allows KZ to last even longer than it should, as there's nothing to stop you from jumping into previously completed levels & trying things out perhaps you couldn't pull off when just starting out. If good mechanics alone aren't enough to get you replaying a 4-5 hour campaign, I'd still suggest it to be worth the money, but you might want to exercise a bit more caution.\\n\\nPresentation is also right up there, with the superbly executed Hotline Miami influenced ultra violent aesthetic driving a surprisingly interesting story. It's message response options often open the door to wildly differing conversational outcomes, which I enjoyed messing around with a bit given how enjoyable & funny the writing is, although even then, there were times where I just wished I could skip ahead & get to the combat again, as that's the real highlight of the title (alongside the OST).\\n\\nExtras? Speedrun mode, a hard mode, different weapons? Yup, they're all present & correct (after beating the game, of course)! The speedrun mode is very customizable, & where I personally find the value in the game to be. My only real complaint is there doesn't seem to be any sort of in-game leaderboard, so the only way to compare scores with your friends is the old fashioned way of just showing em a picture - Which is fine! But hey, a leaderboard would've been nice. Still, with features like level by level death/time tracking, the ability to skip any & all story content, use different weapons & so on, paired with its satisfying gameplay, make KZ a very appealing title for speedrunners of all levels.\\n\\nOverall, I enjoyed my time with Katana ZERO quite a lot, & wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone who feels they'd be able to find value in the post game extras/speedrunning aspect of it. If replaying/speedrunning isn't really your thing, I'd still very much recommend it, albeit with a lot less enthusiasm.\"},\n",

You are given an interesting amount of movement options, weapons, and special abilities to fight, and enemies get progressively more difficult to deal with, or at least in more unique ways of combating. Movement itself can be a bit finicky, and while new features are introduced and explained well, the layout on keyboard can be a bit cramped when you need to pull off precise movements and inputs in a row. \"Aiming\" with your sword strikes in particular often cancels your movement unless you have both positioned perfectly, which is hard to do simultaneously when adapting to combat. The quick nature of respawning does ease this problem. The main game is just a few quick hours, but alternative objectives and new game plus modes most likely add replayability. A few mechanics and elements feel like untapped potential. The story is mysterious, thrilling, and shocking, and allows for some choice in dialogue and light branching story, although this would be better if more fleshed out with more routes and choices affecting the story or gameplay more. Music and presentation are excellent, a very flashy and colorful aesthetic. Certainly a blast to play through and discover. This is a very good foundation, but would be a must play with some polish, better features and customization options, and more campaign content. 7.8 out of 10 for the strong gameplay and killer story, but with a bigger scope than presented and elements that will hopefully be addressed in a sequel.'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"Indie games tend to lean heavily between gameplay and story.  Usually one is definitively the lead foot and the other is less of a focus for the developers.  Once in a while, a smaller developer brings a little more to the table, maybe making a more balanced game in those categories.  Katana Zero, however, is one of the first times I’ve seen so much effort placed in both creating compelling gameplay and a dense story coming out of an indie studio.\\n\\nAbbreviated Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37Dt2XHia1o\\n\\n[h1]The Familiar Territory[/h1]\\nDevolver Digital seems to enjoy publishing indie games that feature violent protagonists and instant or near instant kills.  Katana Zero takes after the recently release Ape Out and genre-defining classic Hotline: Miami by putting you in the role of a character with a penchant for violence and a katana that is exceptionally good at making your enemies dead.  However, in playing it, it reminded me significantly of another non-Devolver game – Door Kickers: Action Squad.  You see, in every mission, you’re usually assigned the role of heading into a building or facility and assassinating target.  This involves bursting through a number of doors and obliterating opponents as quickly as possible.  In practice, it feels so similar to that game (along with the synthwave aesthetic) that I would have assumed the same company developed them if I didn’t know any better.  However, the real meat of the gameplay involves a time-warping mechanic that is very distinct to Katana Zero.\\n\\nTwisting time takes a couple of forms within the game.  You already have the lightning fast ability to swing your sword and throw various objects around the map, but you can also slow down time to better execute some of the trickier maneuvers in the game.  For instance, you can deflect bullets back at their source with a well-timed sword slash, but achieving this without slowing down time can be tricky – even though if you actually do it, you feel like a badass.  Slowing time can also allow you to make better use of your (i-frames included) dodge roll that is often the deciding factor between life and death.   Yet death isn’t really that much of a problem for this protagonist. \\n\\n[h1]It’s Rewind Time[/h1]\\nPart of the 80s synthwave aesthetic is that you ‘rewind’ time, much like a VCR (tape lines included), to go back to the beginning of the room and try it all again.  This essentially makes it impossible to lose, but you can still fail as many times as you can tolerate it.  There will be points where it feels like Super Meat Boy in how many times you suck and have to restart, and just like that classic game, you’ll start hating portions of the game where you just can’t seem to get the timing down.  These moments actually play into the game and become part of the story in a way that I don’t want to spoil, but made encountering a fail state multiple times feel like there was always a chance to trigger something cool.  It made a great connection between the key gameplay mechanic and the story itself.\\n\\n[h1]The Story Itself[/h1]\\nKatana Zero is a short game, so the story picks up quickly - meaning there aren’t many things I can talk about without spoiling it.  However, I can also say the story is so erratic and at times hard to follow that I don’t know if I outright tried to explain it, I’d be accurate enough to say it ruined anything.  Regardless, one of the main threads is that you are in the role of an ex-soldier who is a veteran of a war in the game lore who is working as an assassin.  In this work, you see a psychiatrist who seems to be in the role of helping you get past the literal nightmares and metaphorical demons of your past with a combination of dialogue-option filled discussion and injections of a mysterious drug.  Yet, he also hands you dossiers on the targets for each of your missions, making his role a little strange to say the least.  \\n\\nThe initial mystery of the story element is compounded through your interactions both during and after when you return to your apartment.  Characters can pop in without notice and seem to know you, but it you don’t know if it’s someone your character is or isn’t supposed to know.  Every character is written with a motive that you’re unsure whether it directly revolves around you or not.  As the story progresses and becomes more layered and complex, you start to see what some of those characters’ motives were and learn more about yourself as the protagonist.  What makes the story the most compelling, and what may be the most frustrating thing to some people, is that you’re often offered a lot of choices in the dialogue that may play out in your actions and you have no idea if it would lead to real change in the game.  It’s hard to say if selecting one choice over another would a different outcome, but it’s actually one of the things I ended up loving.  At one point, you can even select an option that gives you a game over screen, complete with credits, and you just have to go back and choose the alternative.  \\n\\n[h1]Perfectly Balanced, as all things should be[/h1]\\nHaving an indie game with good gameplay or a good story is great.  Having one with both is even better.  However, having a game with both supporting one another is just amazing.  Katana Zero is amazing.  Even in my moments of frustration when I had no idea what the hell I had to do to beat an area or a boss, I still felt like the goal was within reach.  The story had me looking for more, thinking back through everything I had done and every event that occurred trying to better understand what was going on.  I wanted more of both, and that is one of the shortcomings of the game.  I finished it in just under four hours and that included some time spent messing around looking for achievements.  While the $15 price isn’t overwhelming, some more frugal players may want to wait for some kind of sale if they expect more time for their money.  I have heard that DLC is on the horizon with support for speed runners and such, so that may be something to wait for as well if you’re on the fence.  Either way, this is a must-play game for whatever price you’re willing to pay. \\n\\n[quote] If you'd like to see more of my reviews, check out my curator page here: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28346672-Endyo-Gaming/ and https://bagogames.com/[/quote]\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': 'The concept of time has long provided fertile ground for philosophical debates. The way we perceive it and how drugs can alter it can turn those philosophical debates into trippy affairs, as well as horror stories. Katana Zero is a pretty good application of that. Set in a cyberpunk world, with neo-noir undertones. You are playing an elite assassin, not very imaginatively named Zero, with a peculiar relationship with time. Zero is caught in the typical web of evil conspiracies of ominousness. Represented by his handler, who happens to aptly be his psychotherapist, his source of missions and medicine, ostensibly for his mental well-being. Armed with a bathrobe and a katana, you guide Zero as he carves a (very) bloody path through everyone and everything in his way as he tries to take back control of his destiny.\\n\\nThe game touches some pretty heavy themes. War, psychopathy, PTSD to name a few. And of course the perception of time. As Zero\\'s powers and drug problems increase he becomes more and more unable to tell where reality ends and delusion begins. As time bends and shifts his foretold final fate may be about to kick in, or perhaps has already happened. Narratively the game is very strong. There may not be that much happening but what\\'s there feels very personal. This, along with the trippiness present, make it very compelling. It helps that the game is very heavily stylized, with the entire presentation working to strengthen the experience. The music that Zero plays in his Walkman throughout missions is an example. Very fitting for the genre and organically tied to the narrative. Even the game\\'s interface seems intent to mess with your mind. \\n\\nThe game\\'s core gameplay loop is effectively that of a 2D action-platformer. Each level consists of a series of areas filled with enemies. Zero needs to either dispatch or avoid them all. Armed with his katana, all kinds of throwable items and time powers. The action is high stakes. As powerful and deadly as Zero may be, he is just as fragile. An enemy as much as sneezing on him will send you back to the beginning of the current area. One hit and you need to start again. This is quite innovatively worked into the game\\'s narrative, via the aforementioned time powers. Zero can predict the future and select the timeline in which he succeeds to become reality. Trippy but conceptually effective. Unfortunately, that doesn\\'t mean you, the player, can do the same. As such the constant pursuit of the perfect run can make the game feel repetitive.\\n\\nThankfully, the potentially repetitive gameplay doesn\\'t detract significantly from the experience. Unfortunately, the finale does. Or rather the lack of one. Katana Zero is incomplete. The game ends with a \"to be continued\" note, which happens right when the plot is about to reach its climax. Nothing is sorted out, it\\'s one enormous cliffhanger. There was a promised free DLC that would continue the narrative, but that was years ago. Not sure if it\\'s still happening or if it makes sense to even take it into consideration anymore. As it stands the game ended so abruptly I was left in disbelief. Besides, the duration of the game is hardly satisfactory. It took me about four hours to finish it. About seven to see most of what it had to offer. This certainly doesn\\'t win the game any awards for copious amounts of content.\\n\\nSo do I recommend Katana Zero? Well, as a game it\\'s not particularly interesting. The gameplay is acceptable but hardly groundbreaking and potentially repetitive. As an experience though it becomes a much stronger sell. It\\'s evocative and powerful, the way the narrative is presented, the style, the concept, all of it is praiseworthy. The lack of an ending and the short duration may reduce the overall effectiveness of the experience, but not enough to make it lose its allure. As long as these concerns are factored in and deemed acceptable, then Katana Zero becomes an easy thumbs up.'},\n",

Nothing is told to you directly about the backstory or the story itself, you yourself must talk and play your way through to understand the situation your character is in. Although a lot is left unexplained, I really love that I was left with a lot of theories related to the story and I hope that the free DLC the developers have promised will answer most of my questions and bring us more of this beautiful game. A lot of people complain that it\\'s short, but after taking my time to answer during a dialogue and choosing how I want to complete a mission I was given, it felt that more time has passed than it actually did and that is something that amazed me, it\\'s the quality of time, not the quantity.

[/b]\\n\\nThe writing is very good and the way it\\'s presented in the game it\\'s something fantastic. The developers used a method to incorporate \"voice acting\" in the game by giving the text change of colour, different animations and types of speed, that indicate the tone of dialogue. You are offered various dialogue options to choose from during the countdown, be it rudely interrupting (resulting in the shatter of the text box) or taking your time to choose the most appropriate answer. Your dialogue options will have an impact on your conversation and also change aspects of the story. [spoiler] Choosing specific dialogue options and executing missions in a specific way will unlock a secret boss fight. [/spoiler]\\n\\n[b] 2. Easy to learn, but difficult to master gameplay. [/b]\\n\\nZero moves like a ninja, he can dodge roll, slash his sword, deflect enemy bullets, slow down time and pick up various items, later to be used if wanted. Slowing down time sounds overpowered but cannot be done over and over, the more you use it, the more the battery icon displayed on your HUD (top left) will drain. Zero has no health bar, meaning every mistake you make that will cause you to be fatally wounded will result in a restart of the room you\\'re in. Each room has a timer, meaning you must complete the room before the time runs out. Optionally, after unlocking 5 secret swords, you can choose to equip one sword at the time, each sword having it\\'s own ability. After finish the game once, you unlock speedrun, where you can play on hard more, or test your skills on normal difficulty. [spoiler] During one level you will be playing as a character named Fifteen aka The Dragon, that can also slash his sword, deflect bullets, dodge roll, but his ability to pick up items is replaced with an instant dash in a straight line that kills every enemy in it\\'s path. This ability has a cooldown, during it\\'s cooldown you cannot attack or use the slash dash ability again. [/spoiler]\\n\\n[b] 3. Very well made soundtracks. [/b]\\n\\nAn aspect where the game excelled. The soundtrack is amazing, making it fit perfectly the scenery or the situation you are in. It can be relaxing, mysterious or edgy. The composers made awesome tracks for this game and I love it.\\n\\nLet\\'s appreciate that the game itself has only 200+ MB and managed to fit so much in it.\\nI have nothing to complain about the game, in what I have written above I hope I proved that this game is worth playing at least once or as many times as you wish.

Sure, many may point to the 4 hour play time (despite more content seemingly coming) and sit there going that the price tag may be too much. But that would be the case if the game wasn't as polished as Katana Zero is. I mean, it helps that the game has reasonably replayability with the story paths and the gameplay has a natural flow to it, where you get lost in the beautiful environments. There's something badass about seeing your replay in full speed, as you see how you were able to reflect the bullet right back in the head, or dodge roll at the right time to slash at an enemy. Rarely do I say the game is for everyone, but I feel that Katana Zero hits a wide arrange of wants/positives that everyone can enjoy elements of it. \\n\\nEnemy variety may be lacking for some, but it works for me here as it takes reasonably different tactics to deal with each, and the level design uses those enemies rather well in placing the samurai in new situations. I do appreciate that those who really get prediction timing down don't actually need the time slow mechanic most of the time, and I can see speed runs becoming popular with the game due to that element. Boss fights were simple but effective, and the game hung around long enough with gameplay variety to never feel boring, but not strained out. Sound design is on point, along with a set of music tracks that are appropriate to the  \\n\\nThe surprise of this package however is the story, which has multiple layers exploring themes of the savage nature of war, the use of drugs to cure one's self, and various other heart touching topics. There's a small series of characters that all have reasonable definition, including the little girl which you want to protect no matter what it takes. You connect with our main samurai, you want to take his persona as you interrupt the enemy's dialogue, and while you may not get the conclusion you want yet, it's a story that's worth following and not just a thrown in segment for a indie game. There's a ton of depth here, and one I'll be coming back to. \\n\\nHonestly, I'm sitting here wondering if I gave the game too low of a score after re-writing this after doing the video review. It's still a must buy no matter what.

       "  'Review Content': 'Katana Zero is a side scrolling hack and slash platformer where you need precision control to murder your way through each stage, as you try to uncover your past. It offers plenty of fun gameplay as you master your abilities, and a fairly free ability to make the story evolve as you want to along with a pumping soundtrack. I highly recommend playing it if you haven’t already, though an average run only last a few hours.\\n \\n[b]Story[/b]\\nYou play as an amnesic katana wielding assassin who can slow down time and uses precognitive abilities to plan your path through stages. I found the story great, and it had plenty of twists I didn’t expect and kept me guessing as to what was real and what the character was imagining until it all came together in the end, though there are a few lose plot points I wish the game explored further. It feels heavily influenced by the Vietnam War, and has equivalents of a lot of controversial topics. Between each mission you have therapy sessions with your shrink to help with your PSTD from the war you fought in, and nightmares after each completed mission. Depending on how targets were eliminated, dialogue options you pick and if you follow orders the story re-frames itself, which can keep you (the player) in the dark about what is happening, or completely change your perception of what’s happening. Are you a war vet having a mental breakdown, a pawn of a clandestine shadowy government operation, or something else? I didn’t see the ending coming, which totally puts a different slant on the entire game.\\n\\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\\nWow. I found this seriously fun to play. The gameplay is simple, but requires a good deal of precision as you dodge, slow down time, throw object and reflect bullets back at enemies as you work towards each target. Even being out slightly results in death, and results in a restart of the screen you are on, but thankfully each stage is small so you aren’t losing tons of time and effort with each death. Each of the stages is well designed, with a few different options for you to move around as you murder your way through to your target. Every enemy needs to be dealt with, you mission guidelines don’t allow you to leave anyone alive. After each mission you have the option of watching your run, which I thought was fairly cool.\\n\\nEnemies are copies of each other so you know their attack profiles, and while they might be generic they are deadly. All of them are crack shots if you are standing still or not using your abilities, and throw in some of the traps found in each stage or environmental hazards makes for interesting combat. You have a few different one time objects you can find scattered across each stage which can be thrown at enemies or used to help you progress. \\n\\nThe game isn’t afraid to change things up, some missions have you progressing while remaining unseen (like sneaking into a prison or nightclub), and encourage you to not kill anyone, while a later stages has you babysitting a mining kart while racing to hit the track mechanisms to keep it moving. There’s a stage where you are chasing down a boss and killing mobs while riding a motorbike down the highway, and a stage where you control someone else who has similar abilities to you but is more in control of them.\\n\\nBoss fights are interesting, with some of them skipping ahead if you fail enough, but most require the precision fighting techniques to pass, and become easier when you have the patterns figured out. The hidden boss fight was a great Akria reference!\\n\\nThe game has some replayabilitiy in the fact that you can load up missions and change your response to certain areas, which can change future outcomes. This can change what you experience in the nightmares and potentially opens up a secret boss, as well as achievements. There is also a hard mode and speed run mode for those who wish to test themselves. \\n\\n[b]Graphics[/b]\\nThe game is pixel based, but looks great with that aesthetic. As you kill enemies, the blood sprays over the walls and furniture, leaving you painting the stages with enemy’s blood. It’s easy to tell where you are and if enemies can see you or if they are alerted, though I ran into a few instances where the enemies were shooting at me from off screen. Depending on the character’s state of mind screen distortion or other effects can occur which messes with you, and feeds into the story. I didn’t experience any issues or bugs while playing the game, it feels highly polished.\\n\\n[b]Music[/b]\\nThe soundtrack is heavily synth based, with a large dose of drums. I found the soundtrack great to listen to, with their being plenty of variety and the mission music kind of energising you, while the music outside of stages feeling dark. Its available as a separate purchase if soundtracks are your thing.\\n\\n[b]Achievements[/b]\\nMost of the achievements are easy enough to get, however the speedrun and hard mode might cause issues for some.\\n\\nFor more reviews please visit https://store.steampowered.com/curator/31327216/'},\n",

Katana ZERO allowed me to feel like I'm playing Hotline Miami 2 for the first time again, something very valuable for me. After having it in my library for one week I decided to try it out. Unfortunately I started it in the evening. It's 7AM and I just finished it, I'm a bit tired but I don't regret anything. \\nEverything you need to know is that you're a samurai and the game exists in your head, you won't make any move until you get things done without being harmed in your mind, then do exactly the same in his real world. You can only die in your mind and if you do you get sent back to a checkpoint. As long as you take your medicine you are immortal.\\nThe chat is something special that I haven't seen in any other game, heard about immortality talking in Undertale (Thanks Sans, very cool), but in tiny amounts. What it really is you will find by yourself if you decide to play this artistic game, it is something that's a crime to spoil.\\nThe soundtrack genres differ on what you are doing: Vaporwave and Synthwave for fighting, Jazz for relaxing at home and Hardbass for arguing with idiots while receiving russian swearing. I loved it.\\nAs I said up there, the game is very aesthetic. The pixel graphics look very nice, I prefer those over ultra realistic graphics. This is the best and one of the cheapest purchases i made for the past year. \\n\\nIf my eyes were still working I noticed that the game was made totally by one person (excluding the music and publishing).

The writing is complex but manages that complexity with perfection, the game mechanics, slowing time, are unique and executed amazingly, the neon VHS cyberpunk-esque artstyle fits perfectly and, in terms of difficulty, it feels just hard enough to make you push, think and adapt. \\n\\nThis is a must-buy; if you don't own this game already you must buy it! This is what I consider to be a perfect game.\\n\\n[hr][/hr]\\n\\nKatanaZero is an exploration into the effects of war, drugs, PTSD and discovery of self; each moment in this game, outside of the mindless slaughter, explores a deep, gritty part of human nature. You play as Zero and, without spoiling too much of this one-of-a-kind story, you spend the entire game choosing a path which will explain as much or as little of his backstory as you choose. KatanaZero does not stray away from the worst part of what makes people human instead it embraces it and uses it to magnify their narrative. This, combined with a perfect score by LudoWic and Bill Kiley, creates what I consider to be the perfect game as it plays like your classic side-scrolling platformer hack-n-slash but [b]feels[/b] like an investigation into man and it's greatest mistakes.\\n\\nI must warn people who are considering playing this game: it is very raw and graphic for a pixel game; you will feel very vulnerable and emotionally-defenceless but by embracing that moment of weakness you will experience this to it's absolute fullest. \\n\\nKatanaZero is a must-buy. It's not just a perfect game that's an immense understatement; This is art. In the ever-growing battle between what is and is not art this is one of the greatest examples of live-art. \\n\\nRating: 10 / 10\\n\\nThank you Askiisoft.\"},\n",

It\\'s easier than you\\'d expect (from Hotline Miami for example) but still non-trivial, and you can choose not to use time slowdown. But let\\'s be honest: gameplay is not the main draw here, at least it wasn\\'t for me.\\n\\nIt\\'s the story. More specifically, the way it\\'s told.\\n\\nThe game takes the concept of \"unreliable narrator\" and runs with it... but just carefully enough to make you actually wonder what\\'s real and what\\'s not. Classic Noir; and Katana ZERO iterates on this concept with creative usage of glitchcore. And when you throw in some serious mental health issues and drugs into the mix... well, the result is potent.\\n\\nThen, there\\'s the aesthetic. Some people think that pixel art is \"bad graphics\"; I won\\'t insult you by assuming you\\'re one of them. Instead I\\'ll point out that the sprites are detailed and expressive, and the animations are very smooth with lots and lots of frames. They\\'re also very varied - for example, there\\'s a mission that takes place in a club, and there\\'s an animation of the protagonist dancing - just for this one room. \\n\\nOn the topic of clubs; the music is very fitting. \"Dark synthwave\" would be my best attempt to categorise it? Slower, heavier Carpenter Brut? A little like Hotline Miami\\'s, but less flashy? I don\\'t know, I review games, not music.\\n\\nFinally, I have a complaint. The game\\'s story isn\\'t self-contained - it ends on a cliffhanger of sorts. Still, it\\'s a Noir story, so a certain lack of closure is fitting. Besides, the rest is so good I can forgive this little thing.\\n\\nWith all that said, I don\\'t think Katana ZERO is as good as the reviews make it look. It\\'s polished and has interesting narration, but something felt missing the entire time I was playing. Maybe I simply didn\\'t like the gameplay all that much. Maybe the plot was  too... \"snuff\" for me. Or maybe I found the general story a little too vague. But overall I had fun and the plot kept my attention, and I\\'d say the game\\'s definitely worth playing.\\n\\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42922988/]Curator Page[/url]'},\n",

It eases the player into gradually harder difficulty while not doing it instantly or too slowly; it's just right.\\n\\nThe music is phenomenal, showcasing intense songs that compliment the fast-paced gameplay, but also calming down at important story points- or even getting more intense. Basically, the music goes along with what's happening currently very well. Plus I just love listening to it on my free time, if that says anything.\\n\\nThe story is something I genuinely adore. While as of now not everything is clear but eventually could be as the arrival of the DLC is still being awaited- it keeps you intrigued. Not only does it display great examples of withdrawal and what being on a drug does to you, but also expresses the mental state very well. We don't know much about our protagonist Zero, and even less about his companion Fifteen, but we for sure know that both of these individuals aren't ok. Zero's thoughts and having options in the game such as defying your therapist and killing innocents like a homeless man give a glimpse into his deterioration, and like said before withdrawal. One of these examples being the rooftop scene. We know Zero's done some horrible things in his life according to the church scene, and we know he regrets them via his words. But, he knows he's done at least one good thing in his life that can't hold him down. Zero's perception of time is fucked frankly, and he is severely mentally damaged, but he isn't heartless. He's a very caring character with his own motivations, and I love him.\\n\\n\\nAll in all, I do love this game. I replay it time and time again or even just a quick session to see some bodies drop, and always remember the importance of this game.\\n\\nI await the DLC and genuinely hope for it soon.\\n\\n\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"Katana Zero is a slick side scrolling 2d Action game that mixes gritty cyberpunk aesthetic with 80's neon, stirs in some Hotline Miami game stylings, and serves it up in a cool smoothie cup. It's one shot one kill, high reflex perfect execution all the way through, and tells a war-drama story behind mysterious machines, child soldiers, and drug running.\\n\\nThe game has detailed pixel art and an electronic soundtrack that keeps you focused on the action, and recognizing everything happening at a glance, while still making everything look stylish, and fitting the game's overall aesthetic. Your character moves with a steady flow, and does so responsively. The game's story is about a mysterious samurai who appears to act as the assassin for his therapist, who dispenses medicine, biting sarcasm, and new missions, in equal measure. The game quickly spirals out as you learn more about the world's politics, wars, and governmental black ops, including secret super-soldier projects. The game takes place over distinct levels with walking and dialogue sections, and then action sections, broken down into levels.\\n\\nThe meat of the game is these action sections, where your job is generally to kill every single person in an area, from club wielders, to pistoliers, machine gun users, and more. Every enemy type acts predictably, meaning you can lure enemies around, know what they'll do and how they'll react, and be in total control. On top of that, you have the ability to slow down time, reflect bullets, pick up and fling objects, and dive in and out of cover. At the end of your carnage, you're treated to an optional view of what happened from the POV of a security camera in normal time, which can be fun to watch if you made excessive use of the slow time power. Every enemy dies in a single hit, and so do you, so combat becomes a planned dance of katana slashes, diving under stairs, throwing trophies and fire extinguishers, and dodging and reflecting bullets, before standing alone in a sea of blood. Each mission has different twists to mix it up, and the game throws consistent new challenges and situations at you all the way to the end. It's not a long game, so it never wears out its welcome.\\n\\nThe game does dialogue interestingly, where you can interject and interrupt dialogue, or wait for it to play out, then make decisions. In practice, this doesn't generally affect gameplay - there's no real decision branches - but it does add a feel to the game where you can react to situations how you'd like, playing hard and aggressive, or more thoughtful, both in dialogue and gameplay. Though not affecting mechanics, it gives more immersion.\\n\\nOver the course of the game, there's also some secrets and unlockables, and when you beat the game, you can use them in future play modes, like different weapon types, various speedrunning, modes, and a secret, hidden boss near the end of the game that's the toughest thing around.\\n\\nStrong recommendation to anyone who loves action games, and especially if you crave the cyberpunk or Hotline Miami aesthetic.\"},\n",

The plot of this game is very slow-burning, however it still managed to captivate me and make me interested in the characters and the events of the game. I\\'m not going to talk much more of the story in this review as it\\'s best experienced blind in my opinion\\n\\nThe game itself is fairly short, only taking me around 5 or 6 hours to reach the ending.\\n\\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\\nThe gameplay is where this game is at it\\'s best. With a mix of classic Ninja Gaiden hacking and slashing, and the quick one-shot-one-kill gameplay of Hotline Miami, it\\'s a great blend of planning out your moves and executing them with perfect precision. Gladly however, the mechanic in this game that allows Zero to slow down time briefly on a cool-down, rectifies needing to be pixel perfect with more time to perform some of the harder combos of attacks. The differentiating enemies you fight throughout the game are great, and each one brings something new to the table and makes you have to think of a strategy to work around their strengths and weaknesses.\\n\\n[h1] Art [/h1]\\nKatana Zero has some really beautiful pixel art, with some simple and effective, yet very expressive character sprites.

It uses all of its elements elegantly, however, it feels like only a third of the plot is presented in the game, then baits for a sequel. The game is a slice of something with all the right flavors.

To elaborate on that: one hit and you are dead in this game. But you can always restart the current scene over again until you managed to get things right. You can also slow down time in critical situations to deflect bullets and similar.\\n\\nHowever, I mostly enjoyed the story and beautiful retro graphics. Without revealing too much it's pretty tense with a couple of interesting plot twists. Your dialogue choice also feel like they actually matter. At least sometimes they definitely are.

It\\'s a 2D fast-paced action game focusing on close-combat. You die in one hit and also kill non-bosses enemies in one or a few hit(s). But the main mechanic of this game make you respawn right at the beginning of each short sections after you die, so you can retry the fight again and again without nuisances of long trek while also encourage trial and error gameplay. The game also give you power similar to \"bullet time\" and make use of slash attack to deflect enemies bullet with almost \"split-second\" precision (very satisfying if you succeed deflecting without bullet time). \\n\\nMission Stages in this game are divided into short sections. Each sections let you approach obstacles in different ways and also let you see your \"replay\" after finishing a section so you can relish the moment you pull off those stylish action moves again (or...like me... those funny \"Oh wait! I survive!?\" moment). Using controller, the control is very responsive and fluid, making spot on performance!\\n\\nWhile the gameplay is superb for the most part, there are some problem with this game. The stealth section of one section could be frustrating more than challenging for some especially those who wish to make a perfect stealth run of that stage because it require so much pixel perfect reaction time at the end of the last section (I retried this section even more times than when fighting end boss). Also while this game promote using various methods but at the endgame ([spoiler]yes that elevator level[/spoiler]) it narrow down your method into 1-2 constricted ways. While this is cool by it\\'s own I still think if the game let player acquire a new power or a new creative environmental interaction it would make that section more interesting and memorable.\\n\\nStory-wise. I like how this game make the protagonist power tied into the story and even played with by dialogue choices. This interesting take on dialogue choices helps setting tone and pacing of the game eventhough most of them seem like purely cosmetics. In between those heated, intense, brutal action gameplay there are some cooldown time with you roleplaying as Leon the Profe--- [i](Oh let rewind that) [/i]--- roleplaying as... herbal tea drinker with seemingly \"normal\" neighbours. \\n\\nWhile there are some good \"mind screw\" and deconstruction of videogame tropes here and there. There are also some cliches and some plot devices that feel disconnected I wish they will connect the dot for us in the sequel...yes this game is a sequel hook but it still has one big reveal at the end.

Sound is okay... Music did it\\'s job. I really like peaceful and melancholy piano piece called \"Rain on Brick\" the most.\\n\\n[b]Overall, you won\\'t be disappointed if you buy this game for action-packed with considerable amount of challenging gameplay for a main course and let the story and dialogue choices be side-dishes.[/b]'},\n",

However if you are in any way a fan of well thought out intricate stories then this game is not for you. The game sets up SO MANY plot devices and plot threads and resolves almost none of them. The world is so large and has so many details however almost none of them are explained. This isn\\'t just your average \"it\\'s up to interpretation story\" because i actually like those as they give you the information you need to solve the answers to questions yourself. This game is different because it is LITERALLY unfinished by design. The game is getting a free DLC that was announced way back when the game first released that should (apparently) answer some questions left by the main game. The ONLY reason this is a positive review is because 1) the speedrunning community is great and helped me enjoy the game way more than i did on my first playthrough, and 2) the promised DLC. If it were not for these two things then the story would be unforgivable for me because it\\'s almost as if it\\'s just 6 hours of setting up for another few hours of crazy conclusions to everything, that just finishes out of nowhere.\\n\\nIt\\'s a real shame because they have something so perfect with the gameplay, i can only hope that they dont fuck it up with an unfinished story. This reveiw will be updated after the dlc drops (likely soon now but i also said that two years ago so who knows), if the story isn\\'t fixed by then it will probably be a negative one.'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': '[h1] It\\'s Like a Gory Version of Celeste [/h1]\\nThis game RIPS so hard and really embodies the idea of a \"combat puzzle\" game. Most rooms require you to evaluate the situation and find the correct plan of action, and then execute that plan of action with decent window in-between each action. Choosing which enemy to kill first, which barrels to shoot, whether or not you should stealth a section, the game has plenty of variety in approaching situations and its amazing. Some of the situations do offer quite a bit of challenge, especially the boss fights.\\n\\nThat\\'s just the gameplay though, the small segments in-between each killing floor really flesh this game out even further. The dialogue options you are given when speaking with the \"therapist\", the small talk you can make with the receptionist, it\\'s not necessary at all but the fact that it\\'s there elevates the series tremendously. The story is also fantastic, with you questioning \"What the fuck is going on?\" quite often. I got very invested in the story and I eagerly await the DLC. \\n\\nThe 2D art style is also fantastic. The blood and gore in the scenes look great. My only detractor from the game would be that the stealth sections are kind of a drag if you choose that route. Dying requires you to keep doing them over again and waiting, but you do always have the option of going weapons loud. It\\'s just you\\'ll have to deal with the potential story consequences later.\\n\\n[b] I would HEAVILY recommend that everyone pick-up this indie classic!

I'm only a couple hours in and I'm loving the story and decision making during conversations. The restarting is very quick and necessary, I found that turning off the rewind sfx helped with the constant rewinds as I figure out the best way to clear a room. When you get the right sequence down boy is it satisfying. So please take this as an early review, I haven't finished this game or seen all it has to offer but I picked it up on sale and it's been worth every penny so far. Art style and animation is great for a pixel based game, one of the nicest I've seen. Music is very fitting of the mood. Controls aren't just tight, they feel intuitive and simple to get the hang of. Mastering this and timing your attacks are where your skills will come into play and some cool tricks can be pulled off with some practice or you could take a more stealthy route instead. I can see myself playing through several times to see what effects my decisions and play style make. All in all a very enjoyable game so far.\\nEdited to add: \\nI've finished the game now and have seen all Katana Zero has to offer until the next update, yet I continue to play because I know I can do better on each stage.

       "  'Review Content': 'In this game you play as Zero from Megaman as he lives in a world only for Reploids and that\\'s why he\\'s in his bathrobe. Zero is tasked by Megaman to kill a bunch of people including John \"El Barbón\" Rose and Daft Punk. He does this by throwing statues at them, even though he has a katana.\\n\\nA sudden guest appearance by V from Vendetta changed everything for Zero. Now I\\'ve never played Vendetta before in my life, but I\\'m assuming this game is just being lore accurate when they made V really creepy, like stalking Zero everywhere and forcing him to do unsolicited home video reviews. Thankfully he was put to his place by Zero, but he was also rescued by a random indoor blizzard. It\\'s respectably topical, but I believe if they\\'re going to bring climate change into this game, they\\'d do well to expand it a bit more. Maybe in the DLC.\\n\\nAnyway, the protagonist Megaman from Zero isn\\'t quite done yet with V so he went to Silent Hill and befriended an exploding robot in a minecart race so he can throw a statue at him. This does not work, so he hopped on a bike until V stopped having hands in being a creep. It was a rough day in general for Megaman, but it turns out it wasn\\'t over yet because THEN another dude sent his own video for reviews. At this point Megaman began to consider a full profession shift, but after a really deep and introspective scene full of imageries and symbolisms, Miamiman decided he\\'d rather kill people than be a movie critic.\\n\\nBut also it turns out, Megaman Zero had sucked in his job and his boss is really mad, so his boss gave him one final job or else he will be turned into former-Reploid. Now Zeroman had to play children\\'s card games (he was really good at it) and set himself on fire in an elevator to truly prove that he was the best in the business. In doing so though only more questions came over to his mind: If he was really good at children\\'s card games... why is he a cosplayer? Stuff like this is what makes Katanaman truly the Michaelangelo of our time; you have a man torn between what he is (bathrobe), what people expect of him (video review), and what he really, truly is (card game for children). He was torn all the way to the end of the game, with trippy scenes symbolizing his inner struggles, culminating in his confrontation against Signas who shoots needles out of his Mega Buster.\\n\\nIn an unexpected twist by the end you can also unlock the Mastery Sword, revealing the game to be a part of the Legend of Zelda franchise. This is why the title of the game has the name of its protagonist: Zelda. In short, Katana Zelda is a really good game, and I fully recommend it to anyone else who likes Akira Kurosawa classics, such as Samurai Champloo.\\n\\nPS: John Wick is in this game but he\\'s blonde with a katana and goes by \"Fifteen\". He still has his signature suit though, and he goes around seeking revenge and shooting dog videos or something idk I didn\\'t play Katana Zero.\\n\\n0/15 Best Katana Jack I ever played.'},\n",

I thoroughly enjoyed the game and have to recommend it.\\nEdit: I have to amend what I said, quite a few details change given how you complete missions and in one stage the narrative is quite different if you dodge cameras.

It is so dynamic, so sometimes there is no time to think, and you need to trust your reflexes, but when you die many times, you will get used to it, so there is no problem. The duration of the game is not long, and it is the best choice for this game because the map design of the game may bore after many hours, so they chose the correct duration for this game. Even though the map design was good on the first look, it is the same when you die or restart the game. That is why it may bore the players.

       "  'Review Content': 'Katana Zero is a game from Askiisoft, giving a fast-paced action platformer with a large amount of style. It has what appears to be a novel new take on the genre, and is both punishing and superb once the player starts to master the technique.\\n\\nIt also is a game that feels like it has two distinct ideas about the experience, though the second half is clearly where the game excels.\\n\\nKatana Zero starts with a simple level and a unique premise. The player is playing a samurai-looking character, who I’ll just refer to as “The Samurai” to avoid any major discussion of the plot points. The Samurai can plan out his attacks on each level. The goal is to kill all the enemies and progress to the next stage. The key to this is that enemies will follow the same paths given the same stimulus, and the player also gets a small ability to slow down time.\\n\\nEnemies are dangerous, as The Samurai is given no life meter, and a single mistake will spell his death, but because it’s only a “planning scenario” in his mind, he can attempt multiple run-throughs of the same level. Once a working plan is in place, the game then shows the character completing the level in black and white footage, likely done to imply it’s a recording.\\n\\nAs a concept this sounds novel and fresh; in practice, it’s less so. While the concept does give a thematic way to explain why the player can die multiple times without actually dying or having some fake construct such as “lives”, it’s done more for the story’s sake as a way to explain a few scenes later. The replay of your actions though is the bigger problem as it seems like it’s a way for the game to extend its run time in the worst way. The few replays I watched had me saying “That’s exactly what I did less than a minute ago, what’s the point?” Again this is done for a single-story scene far later, and while the replay is skippable, it doesn’t add much to the experience.\\n\\nThe gameplay of the “planning session” is excellent though. The controls are extremely tight, the combat is fast, and the player feels like he’s both powerful at times, such as being able to deflect bullets back at enemies who shoot at him, and powerless, such as when an enemy shoots a shotgun with multiple pellets.\\n\\nThe core gameplay loop is fast, where The Samurai has to keep on his toes to be sure to dodge attacks, deliver fatal blows, and more, and since everything dies in one hit, players can tear through enemies always aware the one misstep will restart the level.\\n\\nThe first few levels are run of the mill but by the end of the game, there are enough tricks, traps, and different enemies that each level will be both challenging and interesting to travel through. The only level I found to be lacking was a stealth level that worked but required a few techniques the game didn’t teach directly.\\n\\nThe same is true for the story. While the first third or half of the story is relatively ordinary at times, it introduces the player to major elements of the game, it’s about a third of the way through the game, where the story seems to buck the trend and enter into a deeply disturbing and suspenseful thriller. Once the story picks up, the entire experience of Katana Zero comes alive.\\n\\nI’ll forgo a major analysis of the story because it should be experienced from scratch, and after watching the full game, the first third of the game makes sense as it sets up the character’s world. But the story also has a big issue.\\n\\nThe game has its major crescendo in the final level and feels like there’s perhaps one final level to tie up loose ends. However, that’s not to be. Instead, the game ends on not one but two massive cliffhangers, leading players to a “To be continued” screen.\\n\\nThe issue is this doesn’t feel like a complete story. While a game like the original God of War was set up to be a trilogy, or at least have a sequel, God of War itself contained a full story that had a beginning, middle, and end. Katana Zero doesn’t contain a full ending, or rather it has all the pieces for it, but the story leaves enough major parts of its ending opening that it becomes unsatisfying.\\n\\nOf course, while looking back at the first four or five levels from the story aspect makes sense, it’s also about a third of the game where the player may become uninterested. With the game only hitting its stride after that section, it takes the player a couple of hours to get the major feeling of the experience. Up to that point, it’s a relatively average platformer, with enemies that won’t challenge the player too much.\\n\\nOnce the player can get past the opening section, Katana Zero will knock them off their feet with the visuals, story, and music. The gameplay is tight that there are a few sections in the final levels that were a pure joy to play. Katana Zero does get extremely good and ends on a very strong note, it takes a good amount of the four to six-hour run time to get there, and has trouble nailing the landing after those final moments.\\n\\nI ultimate give Katana Zero an arbitrary\\n\\n7/10\\n\\nI look forward to a future DLC and likely sequel, but I also think there could have been a move to tell the full story in a single title, rather than releasing what feels like 80 percent of the full tale in one game.\\n\\nIf you enjoyed this and want to see more from me, you can check out my youtube channel at\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/KinglinkReviews'},\n",

Both have an amazing synthwave soundtrack that perfectly synchronizes with the onscreen art and action. However, where Katana Zero stands out is how it implements the death mechanics into the story line and gameplay. Rather than serving as a gameplay mechanic, the story revolves around your character\\'s ability to seemingly control time. \\n\\nThe story, due to how it handles this mechanic, is bizarre and scattered and it is left to the player to piece together through the dialogue and environment. Do not underestimate the dialogue system either, smashing continue will result in you insulting the characters as you essentially throw away the story to save a few meaningless minutes. A broad synopsis would be this: You are a warrior for hire, and your employer tasks you to kill various workers and as a reward for a successful job, you are given your \"medicine\". However, as you continue you regain past memories you begin to uncover that there is much more going on behind the scenes.\\n\\nTo summarize everything:\\n[list]\\n[*]The art style and synthwave soundtrack blend perfectly with the gameplay\\n[*]Characters are colorful, easy to get attached to, and they too are tied to the death-mechanics.\\n[*]Story is fantastic and weird and may take a more than a single playthrough before you can really start to figure out what is going on\\n[*]Instant-death mechanics encourage many, many deaths until you get it right, and will require paitence.\\n[*]Your choices matter with a branching dialogue system that will keep track of the dialogue you\\'ve skipped\\n[/list]'},\n",

It does keep things interesting and makes you guess but sadly once it ends it just leaves things up in the air, ultimately leaving us unsatisfied with its conclusion. \\n\\nGenerally, I'm glad when a good game gets a sequel however the way the story is presented in Katana ZERO, it pretty much feels cut in half. For an indie game that's a no-no in my books, especially for a 3-4 hour game. The only redeeming quality is that the story feels rather cool and intriguing and I do want to learn what the hell the whole deal is with the main character and his background. \\n\\nStory rating: 7/10\\n\\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\\nThe gameplay is fun, no doubt about it, and it can get frustrating in some occasions however it is nothing special. It keeps the game entertaining until the end but I wish they would've made things more complex with the levels or combat design.\\n\\nAs it is, it's a fun instant death hack and slash with some cool boss fights, a game that does not try to impress you but rather wants you to simply enjoy it. Once you get the hang of it, things get easier even if the game puts you in tough spots and by the end of it you're just breezing through it like it's nothing. \\n\\nGameplay rating:  7.5/10\\n\\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\\nMy main expectation when I bought the game was the soundtrack. Since you can clearly see some similarities with Hotline Miami and the way the protagonists puts on his music player before the level, I honestly was expecting some amazing synth-like songs only to be disappointed. \\n\\nThe songs are not bad, they're actually good enough but nowhere near my level of hype, but I guess that's my fault. \\n\\nThere is no voice acting in the game and the sound effects are pretty much average.\\n\\nAudio rating:  7.5/10\\n\\n[h1]Graphics, performance and tech analysis[/h1]\\nThe game runs perfectly as expected from a 2D pixel game and there were no major or minor bugs to encounter.\\n\\nThe art style and overall atmosphere/level design are left to be desired. I never once stopped to admire the pixelated backgrounds or the levels themselves. They never truly shine, unfortunately. At best they're okay. \\n\\nGraphics, performance and tech analysis score: 7/10\\n\\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\\nHonestly, I was expecting something more, maybe it's my own fault for getting hyped for something similar to Hotline Miami and while Katana ZERO certainly isn't a bad game at all, it really isn't that special and the only interesting thing going for it, sadly is unfinished and cut in half. I suppose you should wait for the sequel if they ever decide to make one and then get both, else you'll just start and finish an incomplete experience. The price is at least low so that's a good thing. \\n\\n[h1]Final score: 7.25/10[/h1]\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': '[b][u]This game was reviewed using Version 1.0.5. Your experience on other versions may vary.[/u][/b]\\n\\n[h3][b][u]Short Answer:[/u][/b][/h3] A fast-paced action platformer dripping with style and quality at (almost) every turn. The gameplay, art direction, and soundtrack are all stellar; and the only sore spot for me is the fact that its otherwise captivating story is, as of writing this, incomplete (but may be resolved with the promised free DLC). An absolute blast to play, and getting a resolution to the story would likely cement it as one of my all-time favorites.\\n\\n[b][u]NOTE[/u]: Players with photosensitive epilepsy will probably need to skip this one due to rapid flashing imagery and intense visual effects, which might be too much even after disabling all relevant graphical settings.[/b]\\n\\n[h3][b][u]Long Answer:[/u][/b][/h3] [i]Katana ZERO[/i] is an action platformer where you play as a swordsman with the power of precognition, able to foresee possible futures and determine the path to survival in even the deadliest encounters. He works as a killer for hire for a secret organization with equally secret motives, but his newest string of missions will force him to question everything he thought he knew--but to say anything beyond that would do the story, and you, a disservice. I\\'ll be blunt and say that I had a lot of fun with this game; and were it not for one glaring flaw--one that may be resolved in the not-too-distant future--I would probably consider this one of my favorite games in recent years.\\n\\nGameplay consists of a bit of platforming and a lot of fast-paced hack-and-slash combat, where a single hit from an enemy will kill you and send you back to the start of the level. Your only weapon is a katana that you can swing in all directions, but you\\'ve got a few other tricks up your sleeve as well: you can throw small objects to kill enemies, dodge roll through obstacles, deflect bullets with your blade, and even slow down time to pull off tricky stunts more easily. [b]It\\'s a game that expects you to die often[/b], even setting up traps to force trial and error on occasion; [b]but it\\'s relatively frustration-free despite that[/b]. Individual level segments are small and everything moves at a brisk pace, so dying never costs you more than maybe 60 seconds of progress at most. It also ties nicely into the story: the gameplay segments are framed as being visions from your character\\'s future sight and don\\'t actually go into effect until you\\'ve successfully cleared the level, making death feel less like a failure state and more like an extension of the narrative. It doesn\\'t sound like much, but stuff like this can go a long way towards reducing stress even when the gameplay is at its toughest. As someone who can get easily frustrated with games at times, I can only count one or two sections where I felt even mildly annoyed despite dying a few hundred times in my playthrough.\\n\\nThis doesn\\'t have much to do with the normal gameplay, but I want to briefly mention the unique dialogue system, because it took me by surprise in a very good way. You have the ability to pick one of several dialogue choices whenever you enter a conversation, and these choices can change depending on how fast you choose to respond. Waiting until someone finishes their block of text will give you the standard responses, but interjecting early lets you pick a more direct or aggressive response that can change the direction of the whole conversation or even end it prematurely. This system is even used [spoiler]as a puzzle mechanic in the mid-game, and you can unlock some hidden achievements and late-game content depending on the choices you make[/spoiler]. It might not be that big of a deal for most players, but I thought it was really cool and deserved some recognition.\\n\\nThe solid gameplay loop alone might\\'ve been enough for me to recommend, but they went ahead and knocked it out of the park in nearly every other aspect of its design as well. [b]The visuals are just fantastic[/b], making the most of its pixel art style with detailed environments, gorgeous color palettes, great use of shading, and surprisingly fluid animations. Everything is full of visual flair, even down to the text boxes and their range of effects and animations that emphasize the tone of a conversation so nothing is left to the imagination. [b]The music is also great[/b], and it\\'s actually the thing that first put the game on my radar. It features a lot of techno music straight out of an \\'80s-inspired cyberpunk/outrun playlist, while sprinkling in some jazz and atmospheric electronic tracks to punctuate the calm moments that break up the action. On both fronts, it\\'s some of the best of its kind.\\n\\nContinuing the theme, [b]the story matches the same high quality as everything else...for the most part[/b]. It was interesting, full of twists and turns, and managed to utilize--and sometimes even manipulate--every other element I\\'ve mentioned previously to tell a story that I don\\'t think could ever be told through anything other than a video game. With all that said, there is one big thing going against it, one that I could understand being a dealbreaker for some players: [b]as of writing this, the story is incomplete[/b]. It ends on a cliffhanger, without resolving the bulk of its biggest plot threads, leaving behind only a \"To Be Continued\" since it originally launched four years ago. Now, they [i]have[/i] been working on free DLC that\\'s said to be over half the size of the base game, so presumably we\\'ll get our conclusion from that whenever it finally comes out. Until then, be warned that your playthrough may end on a low note as you experience the same \"Wait, is that it?\" moment that I did.\\n\\n[b]You can beat the game in 4-5 hours, but doing so offers multiple opportunities to extend your playtime if you\\'re looking for more[/b]: hard mode, speedrun mode, a bunch of easily missed hidden achievements to unlock, and even an April Fool\\'s update that completely rewrites the story (details on accessing that [url=https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/460950/view/6660301466800760588]here[/url]). It\\'s stylish, it\\'s exhilerating, it\\'s an absolute treat to the eyes and ears, and most important of all, it\\'s just downright fun to play. [b][u]Although I was disappointed by the story\\'s unfinished state, the quality of the rest of the experience is just high enough that [i]Katana ZERO[/i] still gets a thumbs up from me--and if the future DLC wraps the story up right, it\\'ll become one of my easiest recommendations to date.[/u][/b]\\n\\n[quote]For more game reviews, check out my [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42524563/]Curator page[/url]![/quote]'},\n",

That's Katana Zero in a nutshell. Developed by Askiisoft, this 2D side-scrolling action adventure thrusts you into the shoes of Zero, an amnesiac samurai with a deadly task and a unique ability to manipulate time thanks to a mind-bending drug.\\n\\nAs Zero, you gracefully dodge, slice, and deflect through stages, feeling like a true sword-wielding badass. Bullet time becomes your trusty companion, allowing you to orchestrate cinematic carnage with style. While the gameplay is solid, it does have its limitations. The combat, while polished, can feel a bit restrained due to a limited variety of enemies and environments.\\n\\nBut here's where it gets interesting. The game's repetitive nature isn't a flaw, it's a feature. You'll replay encounters multiple times to perfect your moves, fitting right into the theme of mastery through defeat. There's something oddly satisfying about nailing that scenario after a dozen attempts, but it can also start to feel a bit predictable.\\n\\nThe story adds layers to this repetition. Zero is no typical hero; he's a loner with a tragic reliance on Chronos, the time-altering drug. It's a double-edged sword – it grants power but exacts a heavy price. The story deftly explores the choices he faces: endless violence or a plunge into oblivion.\\n\\nInteractive moments and dialogue choices give you some control over Zero's journey. These segments, while not drastically affecting the main plot, deepen your connection with him and his struggles. The narrative unfolds against a backdrop of dark, meticulously animated scenes that blend seamlessly with the gameplay.\\n\\nThe game's atmosphere oozes neon-lit grit, with pulsating music enhancing both action-packed sequences and story-driven dialogues. Sure, Katana Zero can be a bit grim at times, and the gameplay variety isn't groundbreaking, but it still manages to captivate. The game's unique style and sincere storytelling make it stand out even in its cynical and sometimes ugly world.\\n\\nSo, if you're up for a dose of samurai action with a twist of time manipulation and a side of introspection, Katana Zero could be your next gaming adventure!\"},\n",

Another factor is that failing is part of the game, progress is retained until you eliminate all enemies at once, and if you die you can start over from the beginning of the area and try again in another way.\\n\\n The game has a great replay factor, encouraging discovering secrets in the levels, finishing them faster and even increasing the difficulty with new enemies and unpredictable routes. The narrative also gains a lot from this, letting you experience several dialogues in different ways to explore the protagonist's story and the world in which he lives.\\n\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': '[b]Katana Zero[/b] is a fun, pixel-art game with simple but effective combat dynamics and a [i]well-written, easily followable plot[/i] (although it may not seem like it, everything is told pretty clearly).\\n\\n[h3]About combat and levels...[/h3]\\nIf you\\'ve ever played [b]Hotline Miami[/b], you\\'ll surely be familiar with this game\\'s combat loop. It\\'s really simple: you have your katana, you can pick up object to throw at your enemies and you have one life. If you get hit, [i]you\\'ll have to re-do the whole section[/i].  \\nIt\\'s easier than one might think, actually; in fact I struggled only in some specific segments, but for the most part it\\'s been [i]mildly challenging[/i], but never frustrating. That is, of course, for the normal mode. I can\\'t speak for the hard mode, but it has the potential to be [b]sweaty[/b].\\n\\nThe overall combat flow is [b]nice[/b]. You can dodge and briefly slow down time, allowing you to [i]counterattack[/i] your enemies\\' bullets or melee hits. It doesn\\'t get simpler than that, but it surely does bring up interesting situations, given that there are a few different enemy types, each one made to let you really get strategic at times. \\n\\nOh, and there are [i]throwable objects[/i]. Can\\'t say much about those. You have knives, bottles and special items such as flamethrowers and sticky detonators. You can get creative with that, too. \\n\\nLevel design is [b]solid[/b]. Each \"room\" has its own well-thought areas where you can set up different strategies. \\nThere were some easter eggs here and there, such as the [i]Quiet Hills[/i] floor on one of the levels: you\\'re into this frenetic ninja action and, all of a sudden, you find yourself with Pyramid Head in front of you. Your mind says \"crap.\", but then you realize it\\'s just a prop and you proceed. I found it funny. [i]Like that robot, for example[/i]. \\n\\n[h3]An interesting twist on storytelling[/h3]\\nWhile I find Katana Zero\\'s story to be pretty simple (but interesting nonetheless), I think that its major strength is in its [b]storytelling[/b]. \\nHaving your plot revolving around \"time\" basically gives you different approaches to choose from. And I think Askiisoft definitely have thought about this. Especially from half into the game.\\n\\nWhat\\'s interesting about these indie titles is that they show that you don\\'t need an extended lore to tell a story. It\\'s just what it is, and sometimes [i]it\\'s enough[/i]. Now, I can\\'t 100% say that it\\'s self-explanatory, given that [spoiler]there\\'ll be another chapter[/spoiler], but everything I saw for me was enough to come to my own conclusions.\\n\\nWhile I\\'m praising this game for how well they manage to narrate things, I can\\'t say I\\'m not a little [i]saturated[/i] from these cyberpunk games. \\n\\nI mean, not that I don\\'t like what I see. It\\'s just that sometimes, these type of games with this settings and environments tend to get a little [b]repetitive[/b]. I don\\'t mean that in a bad way, but there are always pretty much the same ideas when it comes to cyberpunk: evil corp, cyber stuff, redemption, war and all of that. I think that Katana Zero sometimes struggles to feel original and fresh, while still staying really solid in terms of animations and structure. \\n\\nCombine that with the \"Hotline Miami\" level style and the OSTs, which remind me too much of compositions from the latter, and you\\'ve got yourself a really good game with really good ideas always getting to the same conclusions as other games.\\n\\nTake [b]Red Strings Club[/b], for example. There are always those aspects, but the gameplay feels different and unique, while telling a cyberpunk story (which can be summed up as evil corp etc). \\n\\nI didn\\'t mean to rant on this, but [i]you get the point[/i]. There are strong elements here that stand out, though. For example, dialogues are highlighted in a way that makes its characters feel alive and real. I could understand what they were saying really well; I did relate with them and their feelings. So there\\'s that.\\n\\n[h3]Then... what to do?[/h3]\\nI [b]recommend[/b] this for sure: it\\'s a well made game and it has entertained me, and I think it\\'ll entertain you too. It\\'s just that, sometimes, I wish something more interesting story-wise and not so much focus on the cyberpunk aesthetic, which should only be a setting, not the main protagonist.\\n\\nMore reviews:\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/bodolovsello/recommended/'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': 'I [b]love[/b] this game to the point that I\\'m sad there isn\\'t more like it. I want more Askiisoft! BUT take your time in making it so it releases as well made as this.\\n\\nStory:\\nI won\\'t real anything but the story will reveal itself slowly over the 11 chapters and is a big part of the game to the point that if you only play games for the gameplay there is a chance you might not like the game too much I believe also to add to that, Katana Zero has 2 endings. Anyhow the game is rather short and as such the story isn\\'t finish yet so everyone that finishes it is still waiting for the Part 2. The game takes place in a mix of cyberpunk with some sprinkles of dystopian city and the character you play is a veteran that fights mercilessly. I\\'m not really telling you much of anything related to the story here but it\\'s good trust me... please..\\n\\nGameplay:\\nGameplay is fast and can get rather intense depending on how you play. The gameplay has no RNG element so people who play this game eventually develop quite skillful methods of killing enemies. The game only has 11 levels so it can be finished rather quickly but normally it won\\'t be finished [i]THAT[/i] fast. You only notice how fast you can finish the game when you speedrun it for the first time. The game also has about 4 bosses, 1 \"boss\"(more like a boss room) and 1 hidden boss. The one fault there would be in Katana Zero is that it\\'s not something you want to play with a keyboard if you\\'re going to try and get the speedrun achievement. The moving keys is a tad bit clunky seeing as to drop down a platform you need to press DOWN however pressing DOWN and another key that makes you move LEFT or RIGHT will lead you to rolling instead of just dropping down. While it is possible to get the speedrun achievement with keyboard, I would recommend that you use a controller instead if you don\\'t want to struggle as much. The thing I love the most about the game is how I make progress in an area even if I keep on dying. You won\\'t die the same way each time because each time you\\'ll learn a little bit more (You\\'ll be dodge rolling a lot to get the speedrun achievement btw).\\n\\nArt:\\nThe art is quite amazing for pixel graphics and what I mean isn\\'t that pixel graphics is normally only decent or bad but that the artist really went out of his/her way to get in a lot of detail in everything. It makes me wish I was good enough to create something like that. Pixel graphics should always have a place in the game industry and Katana Zero shows why.\\n\\nMusic:\\nMusic is aaaaamaaazzziiinnnggggggg and each area has it\\'s own song including that bosses have their own as well. I went into the game like any other expecting to like 1 or 2 songs but I ended up loving most of the songs in the game, even the  hardbass ones I\\'m normally not a fan off.\\n\\nOverall:\\nAn honestly top-notch game that\\'s completely worth getting, it does have it shares of faults control wise but the good outweigh the bad to an extreme amount in this game however I still have to warn everyone that if you want to play Katana Zero, you don\\'t want to just play it for the gameplay, you have to be someone that also enjoy the story side of the game and well... use a controller if you don\\'t want to suffer as much in speedrunning. Tip on hardcore mode and maybe also on speedrunning (is a slight spoiler) [spoiler] I recommend using the Sword of Masters because it basically has an infinite amount of projectiles you can shoot with only a short CD you need to wait for.[/spoiler]\\n\\nWelp you got this far in my first review so the curse is on you now.

       "  'Review Content': 'Holy shit, what a great game!\\n\\u2028\\u2028Katana Zero is amazing in all aspects: gameplay, story, art, replayability, and soundtrack. And to keep this review short, I’ll summarize what all those elements make the game incredible, unique, and something that stands out from all other indie games.\\u2028\\u2028\\n\\nTHE GAMEPLAY:\\u2028\\u2028\\n\\nThe gameplay is very simple: One slash of your sword kills your enemy, and one bullet kills you instantly. This mechanic is enough to make the game not entirely hard, but rather challenging. The idea is to always keep your eyes open, slashing your enemies one at a time. If you’re not too confident about your reflexes, that’s not a problem, because the game also has a slow-mo feature! It’s extremely useful to deflect bullets and gives you enough time to make you plan your moves!\\u2028\\u2028\\n\\nTHE STORY (SPOILERS-FREE):\\n\\n\\u2028\\u2028The story takes place in the Third District of New Mecca, where the main character, Zero, resides. Zero is a professional assassin who looks for answers about his past, while receiving some sort of treatment from his psychiatrist. As the story progresses, a few questions are answered, and more questions keep showing up on the player’s mind, trying to tie each and every element of the story together. By the time I’m writing this review, there’s already a free DLC around the corner to cover probably all the questions a player can have while playing Katana Zero.\\u2028\\u2028\\n\\nTHE ART:\\u2028\\u2028\\n\\nIt doesn’t matter if you’re not a big fan of pixelated games or not, you have to believe me when I say the art of Katana Zero is impressive. The game is very colourful, and each level has so many details, it’s honestly jaw-dropping! The lighting effects are also super awesome to notice.\\u2028\\u2028\\n\\nREPLAYABILITY:\\n\\n\\u2028\\u2028I have to be honest: by the time I’m writing this, I have 21.3 hours in this game, and that’s not only because I’ve played the story mode several times. Once you complete the game, you’ll unlock the speedrun mode, which is the main reason I’ve spent so much time in this game. If you’re an aspiring speed runner like me, I strongly recommend you to enjoy the experience of the game first, and then challenge yourself by getting platinum medal on the speedrun mode!\\n\\nSOUNDTRACK:\\n\\nIt only takes two EDM artists to make Katana Zero so stylish: LudoWic and Bill Kiley. Without any personal exception, all songs are awesome and perfectly fits the atmosphere of each scene in the game.\\u2028\\u2028\\n\\nCONCLUSION:\\n\\n\\u2028\\u2028Katana Zero may be a short game. Seriously, you can actually beat it in one hour. But everything that’s been mentioned here is a summary of all I actually wanted to talk about this game, and by personal experience, this game is one of my favourite indie games ever. If you’re a player who’s looking for good gameplay, with some varieties, Katana Zero is for you. If you’re a player who appreciates a good story, Katana Zero is for you, if you’re a player who loves pixel art… well, you get the idea.\\n\\n\\u2028\\u2028\\u2028I give this game a 4.7 out of 5 rating. Once I get to play the Free DLC, I’ll give it a 5 out 5 rating.\\u2028\\u2028\\n\\nSee you in a next review!'},\n",

Use your incredibly sharp blade, stealth, insane reflexes and time manipulation to slaughter your targets and all who stand before you.\\n\\nYour enemies will die in a single hit, that hit feels nice and weighty, and they go down with a glorious spray of blood as the impact sends them flying across the room, which all makes taking them down feel wonderful. But you also go down in one hit, so you better watch out! Dying in a section means you have to repeat it entirely, but they're each pretty short (even the longest can be completed in a few minutes I think), so it generally feels manageable, even for those sections with parts you just can't get right. Regular gameplay is a frantic loop of making your way through a stage, as you take care not to get hit, dispose of your enemies quickly, mess up that one part ever so slightly, then die, restart and do it all again until you get it right, and it is wonderful. You also have the ability to slow down time to make trickier maneuvers easier to pull off.\\n\\nThe art is nice, it's pixel-y with a lot of interesting effects thrown in, and has something of a retro cyberpunk aesthetic to it. The music does a great job of setting the mood for your killing sprees. The story is also really interesting, far above what I would have expected, and is certain to impress you, horrify you, leave you asking questions, and also sadly leave you feeling unfulfilled in some respects, as some threads aren't fully explored by the game's end.\\n\\nIt's an amazing game overall, would highly recommend it to anyone fond of 2D action games.\"},\n",

This game is nothing but the finest combination of artful story-telling, great stylish graphics, fast-paced fair action and just seriously one of the best games to sink your teeth into over the weekend. The only complaint I'd have is that the story is left a bit open (with free DLC coming soon which will hopefully wrap it up), but don't let that detract you from purchasing this experience and robbing yourself from the chance to finally feel like John Wick - if only he was wielding a sword instead of a gun.\\n\\nAt first I had some reservations about the overall playtime with story being only about 4 hours long, but after realising that hard mode is not just the same levels with inflated hit points I've found another 4 hours of enjoyment from that part as well. While hard mode is satisfying by itself, the best feeling is coming back to the normal game and feeling like a proper Katana-wielding god of death slashing fools like there is no tomorrow, the game presents yet another challenge to you via the form of a speed run. I've always found speedrunning interesting, but never really had the time or dedication needed to truly devote myself to a particular game, but Katana Zero has successfully lulled me into completing the Gold Medal achievement which requires you to beat the game under 30 minutes. After some Googling and about 6 more hours, I've managed to do it - all thanks to the masterful difficulty progression that was so meticulously put together by the developers.\\n\\nTruly, if you have any love for action platformers and want an experience that keeps offering more in new and inventive ways, look no further.

       "  'Review Content': 'Holy sh*t dude, Katana ZERO. I was half-expecting the game to be yet another overhyped indie that I wouldn\\'t really jive with, but this game honestly gets the praise it deserves. \\n\\nOne would be quick to compare the game to Hotline Miami, but I think Katana ZERO is far more visceral and aggressive than Hotline. The defensive options that the player has can be used to further augment an aggressive push-oriented playstyle. The dodge roll can not only be used to dodge bullets, but it can be used to move closer to the enemy or just to reduce the delay between slashes. Not to mention you can reflect bullets with a well timed slice. It just feels so right when you get a good spree going. Even though there is some items you can toss, combat is most often up close and personal.\\n\\nThe game is fairly difficult at times, since you can die just as easily as you can kill. The game gives you the ability to slow down time to try and think more about your next move, but I find myself using it as a panic button more often than not. Since the game is a bit strict on getting good timing down, having the ability to slow the pace to the player\\'s will can help out, but I think I would have preferred something a little different. There was a different indie game I played years ago called Gunpoint that had this feature where if you died, you had the option to rewind 1 to 5 seconds before you died, so you can instantly try to redo the dumb thing you did in hopes that it would work if you did it better. I would\\'ve liked a feature like that in Katana ZERO, since dying means you have to restart a part in the level, and some parts in some levels take a really long time to do. You could argue that this reduces the consequences and tension to dying, but I\\'d argue that having this feature would keep the momentum of aggression flowing by being able to instantly try again the moment you screw up. Mistakes could still be punished if you, say, limit the amount of times you can go back a few seconds before restarting.\\n\\nThe stealth sections in this game, as cool as they are on paper, don\\'t really fit with the design of the game. I suppose they do fit with the thematics and story, but they slow the pace of the game down to a literal crawl. Even though they are optional, I had the impression that you had to stealth in order to get better results. I think the main problem with the stealth is that it would work in a game where you\\'re more vulnerable, and you\\'re not some killing machine. The moments the game tells you specifically not to kill bad guys kinda frustrates me with my compliance, all because I\\'m lead to believe that I might have to just sneak on by.\\n\\nThe story of the game is surprisingly compelling for a game all about assassinating targets. There\\'s slow moments where you\\'re just lounging around your place, drinking herbal tea and watching the latest news of some supposed \"Dragon\". Then you\\'re talking to your psychiatrist who prescribes you with time drugs. The dialogue and the world feels real for its setting, and the writing is evidently on point. Granted, you wouldn\\'t play a game like this just for its story, but it is cool to have that. It makes the game more memorable overall.\\n\\nThe soundtrack, and to an extension, the aesthetics of the game follow the trend of returning to the roots of the 80s. You got the VHS style rewinding and those classic synths. For me, that sort of thing is starting to wain on me due to overexposure, but I can still admire it for what it is. I especially love the settings screen that\\'s just blue and while like back then. You even continue where you left off by loading VHS tapes into a TV. Having said all that, the soundtrack just feels serviceable at the least. I\\'ve never felt like at one point that the OSTs really added to the experience, but maybe I\\'m just biased and would really love to kill to some Carpenter Brut blasting loudly. I think where the soundtrack is best is for those chill moments when you\\'re not killing. They really make you feel all cozy inside. I can say the same for the game\\'s entire sprite work and sound design. Everything feels like it has terrific impact and weight to it; everything just fits perfectly.\\n\\nAt the time of writing this, I haven\\'t beaten the game yet, but I feel like I\\'m already half-way through it. For the experiences I\\'ve had with the game though, it is well worth the price. I\\'ve been coming home from work at my crummy job always thinking \"I can\\'t wait to get back and play Katana ZERO\" and these days I\\'ve hardly had that feeling. I\\'ve never played a game this damn good in a long time, and with recent updates involving hard mode and speedrunning, I am ever so eager to see what lies in store for the rest of the game, and whatever it might offer in the future.\\n\\nEDIT: I beat Katana ZERO twice and I am confident to say that I have seen all there is to the game in its current state. This game is probably the best game I have had the chance to play this summer. I\\'d also like to mention that the soundtrack has grown on me a bit.'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': 'Right now, Katana ZERO is only one part of a larger picture. This part has a stylishly crafted, mysterious story paired with frantically chaotic, difficult but fair gameplay. The issue is that it ends right as the ball gets rolling. Great game, but I\\'d advise waiting for the story to finish; that, or pick it up on a good sale. \\n\\nIt should have been titled Katana ZERO: Part I or released in Early Access, but I\\'m rather satisfied with what I got for now. Be prepared for lots of Hotline Miami comparisons, because I\\'m going all in on those comparisons. The gameplay was fun, almost like a side-scrolling Hotline Miami. Insanely fast, one hit one kill gameplay where you frantically scramble to move as you\\'ve just messed up your original plan. Brutal, fluid and especially satisfying when you pull it off.\\n\\nRemember how Hotline Miami was broken into several parts? Katana ZERO was definitely made of parts but they only included part one. Like Hotline Miami, the story is mysterious, brutal and oozing in outrun style that leaves you constantly wondering just what is real and what isn\\'t.

      "Review Content: Framing is an oft-overlooked element of game design. Sure, you can slap bullet time or save points into your game without explanation, but making them part of the narrative can provide unparalleled immersion for even the most outlandish titles. That’s what makes games like Katana ZERO such rare joys, the fact that every single element of the presentation is tied to the narrative and mechanics. From your time-bending powers all the way to the VCR you select stages on, this intense, bloody journey builds layers of meaning and intrigue around a single, compelling core: getting through this neo-noir hell with as much style as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the rain-slicked streets of a grim neon city you arrive, clad in but a bathrobe and armed with only cold Japanese steel. The voice on the other end of your phone wants you to kill everyone in the strange factory you find yourself at, a simple task once you start slowing down time to the point where you can deflect bullets with a sword. Room by room you expunge all life almost effortlessly, painting the walls with blood from an impossibly quick blade. When your task is done you return to your hovel of an apartment, your nightmares, your appointment with that voice on the phone, your neighbors, your demons, your rivals, your doubts, your fears, and the truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "To say anything more would be to spoil one of the most intense and twisting narratives you’re ever going to get from a platformer, one that I’m going to be mulling over for days if not weeks. Your hobo samurai has a lot of people interested in his mysterious combat prowess, while at the same time you get to play through vignettes of his life as an attempted citizen. There’s often more drama in these little glimpses of city life than in the machinations of war and government he’s caught in, thanks to some excellent writing and world-building. Just the way factions from the war are mentioned, or districts of the city, or famous figures is enough to make the setting pop in a way that few games can.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than this, though, is how the brilliant dialog system puts you right in the center of the story. It’s one of those where your responses are on a timer, and you must make your dialog choice before time runs out. However, most choices also give you a tiny window at the start where you can interrupt the person speaking. Interruptions can lead to wildly different paths through the dialog, and sometimes affect gameplay beyond that. And it’s all done in lavishly colored animated text that floats over the speakers, highlighting key terms for emphasis and shattering on interruptions. Just when you think you’ve seen everything Katana ZERO does with this mechanic, I assure you it will find a way to surprise you.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s really the beauty of this one across all its features, that it will never stop surprising you. Every mechanic and detail will eventually get used in a way you didn’t see coming, and that happens most frequently in the action itself. As a godlike samurai assassin, you have only your sword and your reflexes to dispatch goons, swordsmen, armed security, and worse. But you can slow down time to perfect your moves, roll past deadly attacks, reflect bullets with your blade, and sling objects like bottles and vases to neutralize distant threats. Each room must be perfected before you can move on, like little bite-sized Hotline Miami levels strung together in a mounting crescendo of murder.\n",
      "\n",
      "But here again, Katana ZERO excels in the details. The action you are partaking in, the ritual of attempting, dying, and attempting again, is framed as the planning that your bathrobed terror does before actually executing. Once you have perfected your plan, the game replays the room for you as if on a security tape so you can witness your exploits at human speed. This is a key framing mechanic, and one that the plot centers on in a big way. And even this will defy your expectations in incredible ways, ways that make the game all the more engrossing as you battle your way through it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot stress enough how polished every aspect of this title is, either. The pixel art is absolutely lush in its animations and special effects, making you feel ever strike of the blade and hitch of the video tape playback. The sound design matches the intensity of the action, and the soundtrack is some absolutely killer synthwave and soulful tracks that carry the neo-noir stylings to new heights. There are moments of levity, like the cosplay dialog options and Strong Terry, and moments of intense dread. There are beautiful vistas, and rooms caked in gore. It’s an incredible ride from start to finish, and I assure you that you’ll be left wanting more at the end of your 4-hour (or so) journey. Katana ZERO has a vision and it stops at nothing to express it, blending style, substance, and action into one of the most cohesive packages I’ve ever seen.\n",

      "EDIT 2: So here's the actual review. I won't focus on reviewing just the game, but rather focus on the area that does not get talked about enough, which is speedrunning the game (the reason why I have half a thousand hours in the game). The game is exceptionally good at speedrunning, it's both easy to pick up and extremely satisfying to continue striving for even better times. Why ? It's because the gameplay is both satisfying and hard, and it only gets more punishing as you incorporate even more challenging ways of completing each room. A few more reasons why it's great to speedrun:\n",
      "- Barely any RNG present when speedrunning (besides the motorcycle section, but the dev promised that he will make this section RNG-less once the DLC comes out) and the RNG that is present only accounts for a few seconds of time variation, so that basically only matters at top level. As such the player's skill is the only thing that matters if you beat your personal best time or not.\n",
      "- The run itself is mostly gameplay, there are no cutscenes that you have to sit through and waste your time (there are like 3 instances total of the player needing to wait ~10 seconds in the entirety of the run).\n",
      "- Most rooms are challenging to speedrun, and each one have ways of improving time. There aren't many situations where once you learn the particular room it stops being challenging or it's impossible to shave off further time (exception being the final boss and autoscroller in doom, but a doom skip has been found for one of the autoscroller parts, so that's epic)\n",
      "- The runs are short, at top level they only take 15 minutes to complete, this means that you do not have to focus for extended periods of time.\n",
      "- The game is very easy to setup for speedrunning, you don't need to setup an external program to keep track of time, since there is an in-game timer.\n",
      "- The dev actually listens to our requests and will change some stuff once the DLC comes out.\n",
      "- The speedrunning scene is active, so pop into the speedrunning discord server and ask your questions.\n",
      "So if you're interested in speedrunning the game, check out the guides section of the game's speedrun.com page. If you have never speedran a game before, give it a try, this was my first game that I speedran and it's a blast, give yourself a challenge first of obtaining a gold medal (~30 min range speedrun), and if you found it to be fun, aim for a sub-20 min run next.\n",

      "[*][b]We need to talk about how extraordinary the dialogue is.[/b]\n",
      "Yes, the writing is good, but the way that dialogue was presented is what really blew me away. The developers used a myriad of animations to incorporate “voice acting” in the text boxes without the use of voices at all. By changing things such as the speed of text appearing, and animations and colour of certain words or phrases, you get a very strong indication of the tone of dialogue. \n",
      "\n",

      "Furthermore, you are offered dynamic dialogue options that change during the countdown. You can choose to take your time to select your most appropriate answer, or quickly and rudely interrupt whoever is speaking (emphasized by the shattering of the text box). Naturally, your answers/actions have an impact on the direct conversation and the course of the story.

      "(b) Mundane actions such as burning your kill contract or drinking your tea at the end of a mission have to be triggered by the player. It may seem silly but the simple act of interacting with a tea cup actually transmitted through the screen and helped me relax after the high-intensity segments. \n",
      "\n",
      "(c) At the start of the action sequences, Zero (main character) takes a moment to put on earphones and turn on his music cassette, which in turn cues the in-game music. As an added bonus, the music is [u]amazing[/u]. \n",

      "In short, you can move like a ninja and are equipped with the ability to slow down time, dodge roll, slash your sword and throw certain objects. The time-manipulation is certainly overpowered but is not indefinite (used up like stamina) and is counterbalanced by the fact that Zero has no health bar; every mistake is fatal and will cause you to reset the room. Each level requires a balance between good reflexes, wit, tactics and adaptability. Optional unlockable swords aside, you do not obtain any new abilities during the game but instead get better at managing your time-manipulation ability to deal with increasingly complex situations. While this is usually not my preferred type of game, the progressive difficulty made for a very enjoyable, yet challenging, experience. \n",

      "[b][-] Given all the buzzing and fizzing effects, this game is indubitably the worst nightmare for people with photosensitive epilepsy.[/b] \n",
      "It’s clear that the developers are aware of this, since they included a warning directly upon launching the game and also the option to turn it off.

      "Telling compelling narratives in video games is no easy feat. Taking a heavily story-focused approach to design typically either results in more of an interactive movie or, in trying to balance both, nails storytelling at the expense of a top-quality gameplay experience. Every now and then, though, a game manages to nail the formula in a way that never feels intrusive or unnecessary. Katana ZERO is one of those games.\n",
      "\n",
      "Katana ZERO is incredibly secretive with its premise, and for good reason. The player takes on the role of a young man who’s seemingly an assassin for hire. He takes assignments during the day and returns to his rundown apartment building in a less than desirable part of town at night. Every day he visits his psychiatrist to talk through his experiences and get a dose of a mysterious drug that allows him to manipulate time (something that has pivotal story and combat implications). The prologue is simple and gets you familiar with the combat system. It starts off as your formuala one hit kill which makes you want to play smart. It quite steadily evolves into more with the addition of the Chronos mechanic. Though it starts out fairly straightforward, the story takes several turns quickly. The writing here is sharp, and the narrative runs the gauntlet of emotions from thrilling to comforting to horrifying all in the game’s short five to seven-hour runtime. I dare not spoil even a bit of the deeper narrative here, but Katana ZERO’s unique dialogue system forces players to make quick decisions that directly impact how the game plays out, making it worth playing through multiple times in to try other routes. The story takes many incredible turns which will certainly confuse you (so try and pay close attention to all the dialogue.) There's very subtle but satisfying instances of foreshadowing to spot which only adds to this game's amazing replayability. With a recent update, speedrun and hard-mode have been added to compensate with the lack of content which offers a lot more to challenge yourself. \n",
      "\n",
      "Quite on the other end of the scale is the absolutely stellar sound design and 80s synth-pop soundtrack. The ringing sound in your ears every time you get a new dose of “medicine” never stops feeling unnerving, and even the measured use of silence is done to great effect. There’s a great mix of energetic and sombre tracks, and I came to grow rather fond of the quaint piano keys that played during the more mellow scenes. Also worth noting is that the names of songs and composers appear at the start of each mission shown on-screen as the samurai switches the track on his walkman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Katana ZERO is a concise, mysterious and rather sombre game. The way it tells its intimate story is engaging as some of the best thrillers out there, though whether or not the story itself lives up to the delivery is debatable. Nonetheless, this is an action game first and foremost, and to that end, it passes with flying colours. Expect to die and get frustrated a lot, but also look forward to a deep sense of satisfaction after banging your head against a particularly tough boss or enemy sequence. There’s a lot of fun to have here and, with the choices you make having a significant impact on how the narrative plays out, it pays to run through the game a second time and try other options.\n",
      "\n",
      "If gameplay, audio, visuals, and story were ammo loaded into a gun, Katana ZERO is firing consecutively from each barrel. With every component supporting each other, the title feels very consistent and well rounded. Any flaws like difficulty or varying times of knockdown recovery can be overlooked in my opinion. \n",

      "\n",
      "Katana Zero combines everything that you need to have in a game, that would be called \"a true masterpiece\" when it' released. It's like picking perfect ingredients to make a delicious meal. But what's more important is that aftertaste that you feel after the meal. \n",

The whole story had been strongly influenced by the best representatives of the cyberpunk genre and I am pretty much sure, that every single player will see this story in their own way.\n",
      "\n",
      "[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole game is represented as a typical \"one shot-one kill\" game. You play as a veteran of a war, dressed in a kimono, a samurai which name, the whole story, and identity remain as a secret until the end of the game. The game's mechanics follow pretty much the same idea: you come to the therapist/psychologist, he asks you a few questions about your health, gives you a mysterious drug and sends you on the next mission. After your mission is done, you come back to your apartment, watch a vivid dream and then repeat. \n",
      "\n",
      "One of the first game mechanics you meet in the game is the dialog options system. The player always a choice either interrupt interlocutor with a nervous response or listen to the end to have more answer options. Usually, this interruption thing leads to unpleasant consequences, while if you remain patient, you have a chance to retrieve some new information regarding the story and the game's protagonist. \n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to combat, the protagonist has the ability to plan his attacks and rewind time whenever he fails. Once you proceed with the story, the game explains everything regarding this ability and how it all works. Since it's a one shot-one kill prepare to die a lot and plan as much as possible during your game. The difficulty's curve of this game can be a little bit weird: you start the game and it looks pretty easy, then few levels later it becomes way more difficult, then it becomes easy again and then everything changes once again. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s important to mention that the whole combat thing is pretty fast, the player can dash, reflect enemies’ bullets, roll between the enemies, make jump walls to get to his destination point, etc. This fast-paced action always keeps you strained never giving a little chance to relax. Most of the enemies can be killed by a single hit, some of the enemies can deflect at least one hit, so they require two hits to be killed but the most annoying enemies are the ones with shields, because they force you to jump over them and outsmart them, which can be a difficult task sometimes. \n",
      "\n",
      "The majority of side scrolled levels can be completed pretty quickly and easily without any attempts or retries. Every single level is divided into small stages and if the players get a bullet in his head, they have to start over from that particular stage, not the whole level. What I really enjoyed in Katana ZERO is that most of the levels can be completed in multiple ways and the player always has a choice. It can be very helpful and quite convenient if the player is stuck at a certain point and the best way is to try something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "All my love goes to developers for making the game equally interesting in terms of gameplay and its story. The more you play, the more you get into the story and feel like you don’t want this game to end. They were able to find a perfect balance between the gameplay mechanics, level design, some unique levels that are different from the regular one, where you have to kill everyone and then just run away, pretty interesting and remarkable boss battles, etc. At some point, you understand that you feel a weird satisfaction dashing through enemies and quickly roaming around the levels to fulfill your contract.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I really didn’t appreciate about this game is an incredible amount of swearings and bad words all along. I never felt like it was something required for the whole game or the story itself, this game would be even better without it in my opinion, seriously it was way too much at some point. \n",
      "\n",
      "[h1] Graphics [/h1]\n",
      "\n",
      "Katana ZERO has pixel art graphics that may look pretty simple from the first glance, but once you play the game for some time, you will see that every single level, enemy and every other thing in the game is quite detailed despite its simplified style. Plus all these visual tricks with neon lights, VHS old tapes, and CCTV recording screens add some amazing charm to this game as well.\n",

      "[h1] Sound [/h1]\n",

      "Katana ZERO is a great pick for someone who is in love with action fast-paced challenging games and once you are into it, you will enjoy the game to the very end.

Specifically, without spoilers, there is a section of the game which is timed, and you die if you fail to reach a checkpoint in a certain time. But the time leaves zero margin for error through most of this section. I am not a speed runner, and there is no reason that section needs to be timed so narrowly. \n",

      "\n",
      "Katana Zero had a gritty story that made you question reality at every turn, with a fairly peppy back-and-forth between text and gameplay. Sanabi prefers to instead bludgeon you with plot points, repeating the same handful of conversation set pieces over and over, swinging just as recklessly as your character between melodramatic and ham-fisted. Sanabi can't seem to decide whether it wants to be Katana Zero or The Messenger.\n",

      "The gameplay suffers a similar identity crisis. The bionic arm feels really good, and checkpoints are distributed reasonably; still some sections run on with a single theme for far too long, and after spending twenty minutes on a one-hit-kill boss encounter where death meant starting completely over, I was too mentally exhausted to care about avenging my daughter.\n",

      "Review Content: Overrated. Looks good doesn't work. At first the game mechanics with the hook felt amazing, but not for long. It's either boring or annoying as hell. Levels are like 30 second before you get interrupted by the story. Of course you can skip it, if you want to. It's not the most creative story, but it is well done. It's just too long for what it is. For me games like this are more about the gameplay, but that doesn't mean I want to skip the story completely. And like I said. Gameplay could be great, if it was not for the boring level design, the constant breaks by dialogue and something feels off about the controls of the hook.\n",
