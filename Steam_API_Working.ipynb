       "  'Review Content': 'I really hate to have to review this one negatively but there are just some issues that make the game too frustrating to recommend. \\n\\nI have a few main concerns, and my first is that too often damage feels frustrating and unavoidable. Not always of course, here and there would be no big deal, but it\\'s fairly frequent. Most of the greatest (IMO, obviously) roguelikes like The Binding of Isaac, Enter the Gungeon, Hades, Dead Cells, etc, make it feel like MOST, if not ALL damage is avoidable. This creates an incredible feeling of triumph when, as your knowledge and skill with the game progresses, you can avoid all the damage of the earlier mobs, bosses, traps, whatever with ease. Saving that often valuable HP for the stuff you have yet to make it to in a run so you can learn the nuances of those mobs, bosses, traps. Unfortunately with Skul, there are times where 10+ mobs spawn, all of your attacks are shattering background objects, debris flying everywhere, the enemies projectiles are going off, and you come out of the fight feeling good, look down and you\\'ve lost 20, 30 health and go \"When the hell did that happen? I didn\\'t even think I got hit\".  It\\'s just SO unsatisfying. The combat feels great, and if this were a typical RPG or something where after a fight you could eat, potion up, what have you, it wouldn\\'t feel as discouraging; However in a roguelike, health is a resource, and when you feel like your resources are getting stolen from you with little input on your part, it sucks. This can make it feel like instead of jumping into a fight, you should hang back and just wait for your cooldowns, pop them on the mobs, and then run away and wait for CDs again. \\n\\nMy second main complaint is one I\\'ve seen several reviews mentioning before purchasing, and can definitely agree with them now. The same bosses and floor layouts over and over and over gets really tiring. Most of the boss fights are pretty fun, if a little damage spongey and less mechanical, but they\\'re mostly fun. But seeing the exact same ones, in the exact same spots, every run brings it down. And basically the same thing with the floor layouts/enemy spawns. A few hours in and you\\'ll have seen the majority of floor layouts of each stage and that also just feels too repetitive, too soon.\\n\\nAnd lastly, the RNG/Skull and item imbalance. So, skulls have different rarities, and obviously the higher the rarity, the better the skull (common, rare, unique, legendary). The problem is that the difference between the capabilities of say a rare skull and a legendary skull is truly insane. A legendary skull and no other items can carry you far further than a rare skull and some top tier passives. BUT, they have an upgrade system for lower tier skulls! That sounds awesome! Except it takes a pretty atrocious amount of time garnering enough fragments to upgrade a skull, even if taking every skull drop door option available. So you\\'re basically always just hoping you find a legendary skull, or at least a few unique skulls that you can upgrade a different unique skull into a legendary with. This is not common. In 8 hours of gameplay I\\'ve upgraded just two skulls to legendary, and acquired 2 Legendary skulls as drops. Now, something that really saddened me was that there is a passive item cap. You can hold only 9 passive items, along with one activated item, and two skulls. One of my absolute favourite things in roguelikes is when you\\'ve collected an arsenal of passives, stacking together in awesome ways that make you feel overpowered! That can make having a crappy weapon, or in this case, pair of skulls, feel much less frustrating, because your other items are helping carry the weight. That just doesn\\'t really happen with Skul. With the 9 item cap, you\\'ll mostly be stacking % damage increases of either magical or physical damage, obviously preferably whichever your skulls deal. But as I said earlier, even if you have awesome passives, and crappy skulls, you just often wont have the tools to get through some of the fights. \\n\\nAnyway, I doubt anyone has really read this far, but I hope you believe me when I say I truly would rather recommend this game, as I feel it is quite close to being known as one of the greats. These issues though I feel are quite glaring, and can heavily hinder your enjoyment of the game. I\\'m still going to be playing it, but just a run or two here or there before the frustration sets in. Hopefully in the future there may be some changes to address some of my issues and you can guarantee I\\'ll be changing my review once I feel it\\'s warranted. If you pick up the game, I hope you love it!'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': 'Every part of me wanted to enjoy this game, and I forced myself to play well past the point of misery to make sure I\\'d given it a fair shake. After 20 hours, I\\'m done. I love roguelikes, roguelites, platformers, 2D souls, metroidvanias, etc. I\\'ve played thousands and thousands of hours of these genres of games that can feel very unforgiving and deeply unfair, but Skul blasts past them all in that regard, quickly crushing my initial excitement into stony silence and leaving me seriously baffled at some of its design choices.\\n\\nTo start off, the concept is great. Little skeleton hopping around, slashing his way through \"heroes\" and switching his head out in Skul\\'s version of a class system. The sprites and animations are great, and the character design is coherent and satisfying. Then we get to mechanics. Immediately, this is where things started to sour. Many of the skulls are so awkward as to be unusable without serious practice (and good luck getting it, because you\\'ll often go several runs without seeing certain skulls). Some are just flat out awful, and even a good skull might stall out if you get the wrong skill when you pick it up. Furthermore, some skulls might be awful or godlike depending on the items you find (or don\\'t). There isn\\'t much player control over what items or skulls you get. I\\'m used to RNG dictating a lot about a run in nearly every roguelike, but in Skul, it feels extreme, like the game just decides whether or not to give you interesting classes or pure trash.\\n\\nNow enter level and enemy design. I truly can\\'t overstate how much these two made this game a \"no\" for me. At first, things are fairly balanced. Foot soldiers, big guys, archers, a variety of fairly tame trees. Then you get into the second zone, and apparently welcome to hell. Now there will be large, massive spongy enemies that do something hideously annoying, and unless you\\'re rockin\\' around with huge modifiers, enjoy spamming your paltry attacks against the maids that summon three other maids, the alchemists that you just aren\\'t going to stop from summoning golems, etc. Then you\\'ve got the \"adventurers\" who vary between utterly harmless and unstoppable teleporting juggernaut, and seem to be another way for the game to inform you your run was doomed from the start.\\n\\nApart from the absolutely wild difference in enemy strength, with some rooms being so sparse and others being packed to the gills with aforementioned hellmaids, the way the game handles level design and healing is dedicated to your suffering. I have on numerous occasions had a nearly flawless run, deftly dodging around and taking my shots carefully, trying to lean into the \"Skill over stats\" ethos. Then you walk into the next room and there are sixty mages, archers, alchemists, exploding ghosts, spinning traps, and suddenly you\\'re 200 HP down and wondering what else you could be doing with your time, because you definitely won\\'t be healing 200 HP back. Here\\'s your 10 HP blip from killing the archer, ninja and paladin adventurers, sucker. Don\\'t even get me started on the \"event\" rooms. After testing out a couple, and giving serious consideration to the risk vs reward proposition, I skip every single one of them. I have what we\\'ll call fairly serious disagreements with the reasoning behind whoever put these rooms together.\\n\\nSo what\\'s the big deal, right? Sounds like \"git gud\" time, yes? Well, sure, but now we have the question, \"Why should I?\" Most roguelikes have upgrades that carry over between runs, and Skul does too. However, the system in place isn\\'t just bland, it\\'s one of the biggest reasons I can\\'t keep going. For starters, the upgrades feel more like you\\'re just missing parts of your character, and you\\'re handicapped until you grind up thousands of quartz so you can start actually playing with a chance. When I die ingloriously in Rogue Legacy, I get to say \"Alright, well, let\\'s spend some gold.\" When I die in BoI, I can say \"Alright well, at least I got that clear before dying.\" Skul I just look sadly at the witch, and consider whether I ought to just stop. The answer was eventually yes. The magic of small incremental upgrades (gotta get them numbers, right dopamine?) fades rapidly in this game, and in no time I was disconnected from the character and had lost any sense of progression.\\n\\nSo in short, I wanted to love Skul, but I guess the developers had other ideas.'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': 'I wish I could give this game a NEUTRAL rating.\\n\\nThe base gameplay is actually pretty fun, that\\'s why I\\'ve sunk so many hours into this game. But after so many hours, I can\\'t say all of that time was spent having \"fun\". I can have fun with a difficult game, and I can have fun with RNG in a game, but the problem with this game is that [b][i]some skulls (and certain abilities) are so utterly useless you cannot properly play the game until you get a better skull. [/i][/b]\\n\\nOther balance issues:\\nThere is little to no \"choice\" in the game despite all the skulls and item combinations. After you play for a few hours every run will start to feel more or less the same because there\\'s only a few usable skull/build combinations.\\n[list]\\n[*]Using magic damage skull that can let you afk screen wipe like grim reaper.\\n[*]Using good physical damage skull with spammable abilities like predator.\\n[*]All other skulls fall into pretty mediocre physical puncher, or completely useless.\\n[/list]\\n\\nThe inscription system is also really pointless, and seems like flavorless icing to me. You\\'re almost never maxing out any of the inscriptions. You simply cannot play the game with the goal of working towards certain inscriptions without playing like a god, that is if you even get lucky enough to max them out. The worst offender is the spirit inscription, I only faintly recall a single run where I even saw 5 spirit inscription items. That means if I played all my runs with the goal of doing some spirit king inscription, I would have only accomplished it once.\\n\\nThe item limit is too low to be creative. Inscriptions are either impossible to max out and would severely cripple your run if you try to obtain them, or negligible when maxed out.  This results in almost every build turning out into more or less the same physical/magical build. There is not much active itemization choice beyond \"build lots of magic damage\" or \"build lots of physical damage\". Again, the inability to work towards certain inscriptions means there is little to no point in the system, and the stats might as well be built into the items themselves because 90% of your runs will end up being similar item-wise.\\n\\nThe better approach would be to increase item limit to something like 15, but nerf all items across the board. This means early game you might be slightly weaker, but mid-late game you get more creative builds without having to sacrifice usefulness. Now you can finally go full shield/protection while still maintaining enough damage, or go 5 spirit inscription king. Or actually build hybrid magic/physical damage (also I think there\\'s only about 3 or so hybrid items).'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': 'Was scissors the last item you unlocked in Binding of Isaac? Do you play Enter the Gungeon blindfolded for fun? Do you think exhaustive wikis and actually being able to see your stats are for chumps? Then Skul is the game for you!\\n\\nThe RNG involved in this game is extreme. You cannot win every run you play, not by a long shot. Every enemy in the fourth chapter is ridiculously tanky, designed to slow down even the most OP builds. A few of the hitboxes are wonky, damaging you before the sprite actually gets to you (especially noticable in the goo in the third boss fight). Even if you understand all the patterns an enemy is capable of, certain room layouts throw scores of hard enemies on top of you at once, making it almost impossible to completely avoid taking damage consistently. You do not want to take damage in this game. Healing consists of spending gold you could\\'ve spent on items on food in the shop, which most of the time will only heal you about 1/3 of the way, and some of the food\\'s secondary effects are actually detrimental, like the pineapple preventing you from staggering enemies. The next best healing method is random purple orbs from enemies. These heal you 10 hp, which, past a certain point in the game, doesn\\'t even make up for being hit a single time by a grunt. There\\'s items that make you heal more or heal very slowly on kills, but the 9 inventory slots would be better used for offensive items to make you less likely to take damage in the first place. That\\'s one of my biggest gripes with this game, is that not only is it absurdly difficult, but you can\\'t keep everything you find. You can replace items, but scrapping extra ones for gold is locked behind the most expensive upgrade in the game, tied with an extra life. If a handful of gold is as valuable as an extra life, then I should be able to buy them. But maybe having infinite item slots would be too easy, especially if the damage bonuses are multiplicative instead of additive. Unfortunately, there is no way to know. The official wiki only repeats the info that\\'s already available in the game, aside from what\\'s outdated, which is a lot. And you can\\'t see what your buffs do, either, you have to look at your items and inscriptions and guess what they are. The devs clearly don\\'t care about making the game fair as they\\'ve instead added \"rookie mode\" which makes you take 50% less damage with no restrictions on unlocks or achievements. I hope future updates fix this game because I really don\\'t hate it, there\\'s a lot to like too.\\n\\nFirstly, the main mechanic of the game, skull swapping, is great. You can get a skull that does magic damage if you\\'ve picked up magic boosting items, pick a different one if you don\\'t like its skills, and grind up some to upgrade the two you\\'ve picked out that you like. Sadly, almost one-third of the skulls are sub-optimal for the majority of the game, as they move very slowly and can only dash once on top of this. The graphics are also very good, with the enemies that do similar things in each chapter obviously being upgraded versions of the previous ones without looking like just palette swaps. The story, while not amazing, is a bit more thought out than just \"standard RPG but humans bad and demons good.\" You can rescue some NPCs permanently, so you can get an item from them at the start of your run, or you can rescue npcs multiple times in different runs, that can give you an item, duplicate one you have, or just give a stat boost. I really with you were guaranteed to meet every NPC at some point in every run, because the werewolf that boosts your stats is amazing. Also, the music is pretty decent, each chapter having its own theme alongside different boss/miniboss themes and the menu/credits theme. The game is charming, but not without its flaws. The fact that they have the audacity to put in achievements for beating each boss without taking any damage is laughable. I wish the head-switching and skill customizing ideas were used in a better game.\\n\\nIf you\\'re a veteran of roguelites you should at least buy it on sale, everyone else stay away.'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"This game looks beautiful and I really would like to recommend this, but I can feel that after 9 hours I'm starting to get enough because of how repetitive the game is and how the game mechanics and games systems ultimately seem to boil down to memorization and building muscle memory and nothing else.\\n\\nInitially, the game seems super fun. The upgrade system for switching the character class and building synergies with the different items seems very deep and makes your imagination run. But I get the feeling that it is never really utilized well. The game alternates between levels where you kill a huge amount of cannon fodder and then arrive at bosses. The bosses have clear patterns and usually, the fights consist of stages where these patterns remain similar but get faster and more damaging as the fight goes on. The issue is that the character builds and game mechanics that work in a fun way in the cannon fodder levels, such as mixing different status ailments, do not work [b]at all[/b] at the bosses. It's like the game discards everything about the mechanics in the boss fights excepts raw damage output and memorizing the patterns. And since you cannot practice the bosses, the game becomes a grind where you either get lucky and get a skull that has insane damage output and that is how you win against the boss or you re-run 30-40 minute runs 20-30 times to slowly build muscle memory against all the pattern and keep dying until you could win the bosses using any character, no matter how weak, because you can avoid most of the damage.\\n\\nIn the end, I concluded that nothing else matters in this game other than trying to get lucky and maximizing just raw damage output. Or memorizing the levels and bosses and grinding the game endlessly so you upgrade the permanent upgrades which I assume makes everything easier. But that kinda takes away all of the fun from the game for me and makes all of the complexity and experimentation I thought would be here at the beginning vanish.\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"As a huge fan of roguelites, this is a tough not recommended from me. Skul feels like it has enormous potential but falls short due to a lack of polish in more or less all areas. \\n\\nThe combat fundamentally has a pretty good feel to it. Hits feel impactful and so on, but the game has a problem with enemies overlapping. This isn't such a big deal in the first levels, where taking some damage isn't crippling, but later on in the game, it becomes a huge problem. The screens in the final area become extremely chaotic, with full of enemies that can shoot lightning-fast projectiles and melee enemies that can't be interrupted. This is made worse by the fact that the game doesn't give the player any post-hit invincibility frames (like every other similar game ever). The result is that you can lose devastating amounts of hitpoints in less than a second if an enemy hits you and it produces a chain reaction. \\n\\nNow, I don't have any problem with games being difficult, but when I can't see what's going on due to the chaos on the screen and enemies standing inside each other, it ends up feeling frustrating instead of fair difficulty. You can even be shot from outside the screen. Most of the time I was afraid to use my melee abilities because most of them tend to lock you into an animation so that you're a sitting duck. For example, using a charge move can often be a bad idea because you can, and often do, take projectile damage during the charge, and there might be an enemy that can't be interrupted in the chunk of enemies you're charging into.\\n\\nTaking some damage here and there wouldn't be so bad, but this game is exceptionally stingy with healing. Most other roguelikes, such as Dead Cells and Slay the Spire, allow you to fully heal between shops or major areas. Skul, however, does not. Sometimes it only lets you heal for 20% HP in shops. The average seems to be around 30% HP of healing. This means that taking damage is tremendously punishing, and careful play is a must. The limited healing combined with the difficulty of avoiding damage due to the chaos led to many frustrating moments for me. It also encourages boring, slow gameplay. In a game that makes damage avoidance so crucial, having clear telegraphs for enemy attacks and as little overall visual noise as possible is paramount. This game does the exact opposite: it has the most clutter I've probably ever seen in any roguelite, and yet avoiding damage is also more important than in most other similar games. \\n\\nSkul features a pretty neat system where character abilites are tied to upgradable skulls that you find along the way. You can also have two of them at a time and swap between them. There are a lot of different skulls, and there's an impressive amount of variety in the way they play. Each skull even has multiple different possible ability sets, so adding them all together adds up to a pretty impressive number. \\n\\nThe problem, however is that some skulls are simply ludicrously overpowered compared to others. My impression after 50 hours is that magic damage is by far more powerful than melee damage. For example, a fully upgraded Samurai skull can't hold a candle to the Archmage or Archlich. Those skulls are capable of wiping entire screens with a single press of a button, while the Samurai struggles to kill even normal enemies despite having an inventory full of physical damage-boosting items, all the while having to endanger himself in melee combat while the magic damage-based skulls mostly don't. This is just one example of the imbalance between the skulls, and there are many, many more. Generally, magic is too powerful, even without the consideration that the magic-based skulls can damage their enemies without putting themselves in danger. \\n\\nThere's also a good selection of items to build your character with, but my experience was that unless you go for damage almost exclusively, especially if you're a physical damage-based character, the late game will feel almost impossible because your damage will be inadequate. The problem with this is that ultimately you're only looking for damage, and all the interesting utility and defense items will start to look unattractive because you know you will need the damage for the final area and final boss, or they will be incredibly difficult due to how long you need to survive in those fights. \\n\\nI did have quite a bit of fun with the game, but the more I played, the more pressing these problems got. I just think there are many, many better and more polished roguelites than this. If you're a massive fan of roguelites and have already finished most of the popular ones, then give this a try, but probably not before then.\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': 'As someone who has played every roguelike/rogue-lite in existence (from most popular to the most indie, to games which have been abandoned during their development), Skul was an obvious purchase. There\\'s a lot of things I want to go over so I\\'ll discuss them as we go, with minimal spoilers as possible, as to why I wouldn\\'t recommend the game with its price tag to players into this genre. \\n\\nStory: The game does in fact have a story, however it\\'s very cliche, and shouldn\\'t be a major factor in your decision to purchase it. The events of the game all happen due to a (spoiler)  [spoiler] misunderstanding, however since the story wasn\\'t an issue, the miscommunication driving the plot didn\\'t bother me as I wasn\\'t expecting much to begin with [/spoiler] .\\n\\nHow it plays: \\nSkul\\'s combat is based on different skulls he equips throughout a run (all random), taking on the abilities and moveset of his fallen comrades - this sounds like a wonderful idea to add variety to the game play loops, however, its the main problem with the game in two categories: balancing and controls. Not all skulls are equal, and playing subpar skulls means terrible dps output, or terrible controls. This leads to frustration during a run. as to not getting \\'fun\\' skulls. This shouldn\\'t be an issue I thought because DPS shouldn\\'t be a problem as a veteran player in these types of games, I just need to never get hit and plainly \"get good.\" However, to add difficulty to runs the rooms just increase the amount of enemies in the room (with little to no variety), meaning taking damage is inevitable unless you manage to get lucky with items and skulls to 1 shot every enemy in one swoop. You don\\'t feel you get better at mastering the game you simply get lucky. Now going over the controls, some skulls are perfect while others give force movement in attacks - this is such a terrible idea because many enemies are on ledges, so you are forced to fall, go back up, or hit hazards. You are forced to wait till you land so you don\\'t accidentally do a diagonal ground pound instead of just swiping in the air. Once you land, then you can start attacking or your dps will suffer and you\\'ll waste so much time fighting hundreds of enemies with belated HP\\'s falling off edges or taking hits. So many skulls have abilities that lock you into animation, and for some reason do worse damage than just spamming attack. Another inevitability to get hit. Overall is was a frustrating experience, and I only finished the game on a few different skulls just to write this review, as the game gets so incredibly easy with a normal skull with a normal moveset with abilities that are better than spamming the attack button. My best way to describe this game is that it\\'s a hack n\\' slash with poor balancing.\\n\\nEnemy and level design: \\nIn short, most of the enemies are just reskins of themselves throughout the entire game, and an extra 2 or 3 enemies in every area. It gets so bland fighting the constantly respawning foot soldiers, and the like. The actual levels are fairly bland with some exceptions, with almost NO variety. It gets especially worse near the end of the game (the first area had a large room pool to choose from) where it looks like they gave up designing new rooms as I fight the same rooms over and over again. \\n\\nBosses:\\nIf you\\'ve played these types of games before, the bosses are extremely easy, and can be done hitless with some exceptions. As soon as you\\'ve seen their entire attack pool then you are able to dodge most of them. The major issue though, is DPS is required, so a good build is needed or you will be fighting a boss for a solid 5-10 minutes taking chip damage and eventually losing. I\\'d just like to comment as well that one of the bosses is sadly a reskinned worse version of a boss in Hollow Knight, almost an exact replica.\\n\\nReplayability:\\nDue to lack of variability which is viable, there is not enough of the game to justify replaying it. Once you\\'ve beaten the game there isn\\'t much else to discover after the next few runs. The combat isn\\'t good enough to justify playing it again either (which is my personal reason I play these games). Items don\\'t change much of the gameplay loops, just increase passive stats. If you manage to get lucky with consumable items it can carry you through to the entire game without needing a good run.\\n\\nTl;dr The games difficulty is artificial, with large amount of enemies and large HP, annoying controls at the mercy of RNG (skulls). If you\\'re into these challenging games then Skul isn\\'t one of them, you don\\'t get better at the game, you just get more upgrades for the game to become easier, as taking damage is guaranteed. It\\'s a poorly balanced hack n slash in essence. I\\'m not saying these games are bad but I was expecting the normal Roguelike difficulty of doing runs and getting better at the actual game. It\\'s forced artificial difficulty to bump up playtime until you can unlock more stats at the start of the game. \\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"Good-ish game, but the enemies attacks leave me feeling like I've been cheated. I especially hate how the developer's version of difficulty is often able to boiled down to throw more enemies at you and make it so there's less you can actually do to the enemies around you. For example take the mini boss fights in the middle of each level. Each level you progress they just throw more minibosses at you until you are overwhelmed, or you get lucky enough to have a ridiculous build that can carry you to the final boss. The game becomes a battle of attrition until you die, or beat the final boss. The game leaves something to be desired, it's a novel idea and all, just lacks adequate execution. From a game where I would expect to be defeating heroes I would imagine I would be fighting small parties, but instead I have to fight hordes of worthless soldiers that sometimes get free hits on me. I would also expect to be incredibly tanky, but end up being able to die faster than I can in dead cells. On the other side of things, the art direction and style of the game are impeccable, and are something that keeps me from hating this game. The music often calms me down after a stressful run, and the tracks throughout are honestly good. Despite being mostly foreign (from what I know) the devs are hardworking and seem to be caring for their community, even if they are masochists like me for playing games like this. In conclusion the gameplay doesn't really feel all that skill based, but the game still looks and feels good for the most part (I'm looking at you, concentration mechanics).\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': 'As much as I will continue to play this game, I can\\'t in good faith recommend it. \\n\\nHaving played many different roguelikes such as Hades, Risk of Rain, Enter the Gungeon, Dead Cells and so on, I can say that while it is indeed a roguelike, it relies on RNG far more than the other games do. All the games mentioned can be played to completion with very little in the way of good RNG and relying mostly on skills, in fact in most of them good RNG can only take you so far and it gets to the point that you require good skills. \\n\\nSkul is somewhat of the opposite, in which skills get you very little if you get bad RNG. This is EXTREMELY evident in the encounter generation. There are 4 types of gates to each encounter, one gives money, one gives an item, one gives a skull and the final one takes you to the shop. 1 or 2 Randomly generate every stage, and it is completely random. You can have a shop appear on the third encounter, and if you haven\\'t taken a money gate yet, you are completely unable to purchase anything, taking you one step closer to the boss with no progression. There is no guaranteed shop or heal before a boss fight, in fact the encounter before a boss fight is empty, as if there is supposed to be some way to heal but they never implemented it. And after the boss fight there is only an NPC with the ability to upgrade a skull, if you actually managed to get enough bones to upgrade, no shop and only a small heal from the boss drop.\\n\\nHaving only completed the first boss and reached the second without completion, I cant comment on any further bosses at this time, but the first boss is rather standard, telegraphed attacks that give you ample time to dodge, with a slightly harder second phase. The second boss however, becomes MUCH harder in its second stage, if you manage to make it. Attacks come much faster than you are able to dodge, so you have to be able to tank through several hits if you hope to win. So far, due to having to start all boss fights with less than optimal health, I have not beaten them yet. The mini bosses that occur half way between each stage are a nice touch, a chance to choose between a skull, quintessence and item upon completion.\\n\\nSkulls are horribly unbalanced, many strength skulls seem downright harmful to the player with how slow they attack, and since health is shared between your skulls and only items increase health, strength skulls have no real benefits when dodging is your best chance at surviving. For the first stage it doesn\\'t really matter, but the second stage is becomes a hindrance to have slow attacks with the sheer volume of enemies in some stages. Speed types honestly seem like the best, but they sit pretty closely with balanced types. Some skulls, like the shield and lancer, seem downright worthless even compared to the base \"skul\" skull. The abilities on skulls are also a random one of 3 (Maybe 4) with some being obviously better than others. There is a good chance you can have a solid skull and a good set of items, but having the wrong ability ends the run. You can upgrade your skulls at a certain NPC that appears after each mini boss and boss fight, but only if you were lucky enough to get enough bones, something that once again is RNG. Unique (Legendary) skulls are obviously the best, but there is a huge difference between them. \\n\\nMap variation is pretty good, I don\\'t recall getting duplicate encounters but I also don\\'t pay that much attention, but some maps are quite inconvenient without prior knowledge, one map in particular has a roof that is covered in spikes with 3 levels. To jump to the third level you need to double jump to make the height, except double jumping takes you into the spikes whereas a single jump wont reach the platform. Small things like that where you need need to make an effort to either jump late or cancel the jump with a dash immediately makes getting around just that little bit inconvenient. I\\'m all for traps that require you to watch your positioning and your movement during battle, but it genuinely seems unintentional and it just punishes you for trying to move around the level normally.\\n\\nOverall if you are looking for a fun roguelike along the caliber of Hades or Enter the Gungeon, you should look elsewhere as this game probably isn\\'t for you. If you wan\\'t a hard roguelike that punishes you for bad RNG despite your skill level, go ahead.'},\n",

The music is nothing special.\\n\\nThe various skulls provide great variety between the runs, and the abilities feel very satisfying to use.\\n\\nUnfortunately, 80% of your runs success is determined by RNG. Before you call me a noob, i have reached the final boss multiple times, but i refuse to waste any more time hoping for a decent run where you actually get what you need. Keep in mind that in order to know whether a run is good or not (and thus whether you should just restart instantly or not) you have to play for an hour or so.\\n\\nThis creates an evil, repititive and boring cycle of starting runs for hours on end hoping for the 0.000001% chance that you might get something that can actually reach and kill the final boss. The reason you need to rely so much on rng is because most rooms and bosses have attacks that are nearly undodgeable, thus requiring you to have a certain amount of dps to finish them. \\n\\nIf you don't care much for winning in roguelites, and just want to have some fun, interesting and varied runs, then this game will be great for you.

To its credit, the world it\\'s set in is very charming and very creatively designed, and on paper Skul has a ton of really good ideas. But the one area that quickly lost my interest is the one that matters the most: Gameplay. The entire thing is a slow-moving, tedious, grindy slog from beginning to end (and this is coming from someone who had patience enough to beat Dead Cells on its hardest difficulty). The \"randomized\" stretches of the levels and the things in them, from enemies to other obstacles to items at the end, get extremely repetitive VERY quickly and basically come down to either \"huh, that was a little TOO easy\" or \"OH GOD, please kill me NOW\"; there is NO middle ground. You\\'re either a Shredder-esque menace who encounters no challenge at all until a boss, or a Slim Jim who might as well be poking all of your foes with a dull graphite pencil (and probably breaking it in the process).\\n\\nHowever, all of that and even the overly grindy process of attaining upgrades that are frankly too small to make ANY significant difference still wasn\\'t quite enough to turn me off to this game. That dishonor belongs to the boss fights. I\\'ll be fair and say that the first two MAJOR bosses aren\\'t that bad (in fact the guard sisters\\' fight was the one that brought me the closest to having any genuine fun here), but I\\'m mostly referring to the various random hero mini-bosses. Long story short, none of them are fun. Depending on which one (or ones, as you proceed further) shows up, you\\'re in for a fight that is either boring and not engaging at all, or teeth-grindingly annoying. Special mentions go to the ninja (who is just flat-out the most overpowered enemy in the whole game) and the cleric (if she shows up in the later hero fight where you have to face a three-man squad, you might as well restart the run then and there because even if you somehow win the price you pay will not be worth it at all). No matter which of them it is, though, they ALL have absolutely ungodly-huge health pools, and you can not afford to try getting aggressive with them so you will be forced to dance around with these clowns for a long time. Not to mention in the middle of the fourth stage, the game will pick a random one to chuck at you again and make them even worse. Eventually when the game decided to throw the already unbearable ninja at me there, that\\'s when I decided enough was enough. I dread to think of what even comes after, because that was the one that broke what patience I still had.\\n\\nToo sluggish, too tediously grindy, not enough interesting elements in said grind (or among your rewards), and it has no trouble at all making some extremely tall orders of you as a player. I really, really wanted to like this game, but too many things in it push all the wrong buttons. I just can\\'t.'},\n",

(and the binding of isaac for me and many other players is about unlocking all the items and archievements, not merely to \"win the game\".)\\n\\n\"skul\", on the other hand is overhelmingly unbalanced; ok; until you reach the castle, there are not too many problems, nearly every combination of skulls and items and good strategy could bring you there – so the fun indeed is concentrated in the first part, as of course this becomes repetitive pretty fast -; from the castle on, most of the combinatons will make it incredibly difficult to nearly impossible to progress..\\n\\nAnd then you have the overpowered ones.\\nFor example, i had the grim reaper and a very good alchemist - yes, their attributes can differ -; in this combination i seemed nearly undefeatable, the grim reaper does so much damage, has so many advantages, you just rush through the stages, even the two sisters were some sort of child’s play, i died a little bit later, because i became superstitious.\\n\\nok; then for another example, i put all my energy in a combination of fighter and rockstar, reached the two sisters, but no matter what i did, the fight lasted over seven minutes, they continued to build up their health again.\\n\\nyou can use the quartz zu improve your character, but in such a limited way that you wouldn’t have to do it at all, if you got the grim reaper for example in the beginning and some good items.

       "  'Review Content': \"Don't get me wrong, this is a fun game and there is a lot of exciting elements to this game. However, the game also needs a lot of polishing and balancing. For the 50+ hours I played the game, I pretty much loved the first 40 hour or so, finding new skulls, items, unlocking upgrades, and all the good roguelite stuff. However, the progress of the game kind of stalls after a certain point since there are really not that many upgrades and diverse build paths to unlock like other roguelite games. The last bit of the progress for repairing the castle just cost too much resources and you are really forced to grind your way through many runs to farm resources, while all other upgrades were unlocked much earlier. There are also a lot of polishing issues such as switching between maps, scenes or elevators are simply not smooth enough, but all these are not enough for me to down vote this game. What I consider as the most detrimental flaw of the game is the drastic increase in difficulty for only the last act of the game. The first 3 acts are honestly a breeze, maybe the act 3 deathrattles can be frustrating, but the overall power level and health and damage of all the enemies are not so much far apart. However, act 4 is tortuous as the enemies' abilities start to hit extremely hard with annoying debuffs, and that is not all. All attack damage, health, and number of enemies increase significantly in Act 4, and you really don't know what is gonna kill you next. I am certainly not complaining about the difficulty, I really love the challenge and I think roguelite games SHOULD be hard as game progresses in stages.

The default control scheme is designed to give you carpal tunnel.\\n\\nI want to preface this review by saving I love Roguelites. Hades, Dead cells, Slay The Spire, Risk Of Rain 2, and Gunfire Reborn continue to be some of most played games. So where does Skul fall on this tier list you might ask? Somewhere in the middle to lower-middle end, mainly because of three major problems.\\n\\n1. Your runs are way too RNG-dependent on whether or not you get a good skull or not. In a game like let's say Hades, it's possible to beat your runs with enough skill even if the RNG is bad and you're given tools to control the RNG so you can get what you want. In Skul you're at the mercy of getting a rare or legendary Skull or else you will be slowly powercreep'd out by deadlier enemies spawning in larger numbers. I groaned everytime I got a power skull because of how bad they were most of the time. This takes a lot of fun out of finding that powerful item/power-up in roguelites.\\n\\n2. There is no way to heal during runs outside of buying health at the shop. Since HP is shared between your two swappable skulls this means make one mistake and take a chunk of damage during a fight and your run is pretty much over. There needs to be a health potion or rest chamber system to allow you to restore some HP and breathe a little in-between fights.\\n\\n3. There’s absolutely no saving mechanic during runs. If you need to stop playing for whatever reason, well, you can't or else you lose your run. This is an egregious design for a roguelite, since often this genre is designed around 'pick up and play a bit and come back whenever you like'.\\n\\nOverall I like Skul and what it's trying to accomplish, but I can't in good faith recommend it right now because of these problems.

Its more...on the verge of being for me but not quite.  5/10. \\n\\nChanges I'd love to see just for my personal tastes: \\n- Boss HP pools reduced.  I didn't mind repeated boss fights in Hades...here it eventually felt like a chore. \\n- Perm progression costs DRASTICALLY reduced.  This is where I hit my wall.  I was struggling to beat Act 2 boss..made it to Act 3 boss once.  All the upgrades 700 tier and 3000 tier were things I'd love to get but the grind to very slowly grab them was just too much of a barrier for me. \\n- Skull upgrades are NOT perm.  This killed so much of the fun and desire to play more runs for me.  Until I finally realized that's not how it works.  Big let down for me.  \\n\\nI have other nitpicks like screen clutter making move telegraphs too difficult in later acts which sucks out the fun for me.  Act 1 is busy but seldom overwhelming.  Act 2 runs into problems and Act 3 just kept going in the wrong direction for me.\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': 'As a big rogue like&lite fan, my advice is to not purchase this game yet. Should the developer add fixes/balances, that recommendation could definitely change. \\nA few current glaring cons: \\n- A VERY large reliance on RNG, hoping to find exceptional skulls to clear later levels and bosses. In the event you\\'re unlucky, you face an unbalanced upgrade mechanic for common skulls: the amount of materials required vs. those you can actually expect to acquire is incredibly tilted. While you might eke out an upgrade or two, the enemies will outrank you quickly without significant luck.\\n- A dodge/dash mechanic that is iffy at best. This is huge.\\n- Battles that are increasingly more jarring as you progress; often requiring speed to rush in and prevent an enemy\\'s large-scale attack while simultaneously dumping a herd of mobs on you to punish rushing. \\n- A unbalanced health mechanic. To expound: many \"power\" skulls require an element of tanking that isn\\'t made up for in their skillset, while the \"speed\" skulls\\' dash buffs still can\\'t effectively evade many attacks. Heals are few and far between, mostly made up of questionably potent single use purchases in shop rooms, with occasional enemy drops restoring a fraction of your already small health bar. There\\'s a reason the streamer always takes the shield skull.\\n- Learning enemy attack patterns is often largely useless, with some enemies possessing skills that leave you almost no choice but to be hit. I\\'m looking at you, head maids and your plate maids.\\n- Unlike in other roguelites, the long term benefits bought with the spoils of a failed run leave you feeling barely any closer to progressing further in the game. \\n- Unlocking a new starter-zone NPC means very little. Expect perks such as a buff that only lasts about as long as it takes to get through the first floor, a feat that should be easy enough on its own.\\n\\nThis is a game that seems to want its combat to play like Hollow Knight at some points and Dead Cells at others. While they might eventually find the happy medium, they haven\\'t yet. I\\'m looking forward to any fixes in the works, and will update this review accordingly in the event that the game changes significantly. \\nAll that said, I\\'m going to keep playing it because I hate losing. \\nCheers'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': 'Usually, I love these types of games (roguelikes, hack and slash, etc.) and you can see that with my game time on Binding of Isaac, Hades and Enter the Gungeon. So naturally, I was really excited to play Skul because it was so highly rated on steam, but I left disappointed.\\n\\n[h1] The Good [/h1] \\n\\nI really enjoyed the progression system (similar to Hades) where previous runs impact future runs in the form of increased base stats. Also enjoyed the different skulls and how they impacted gameplay in meaningful and enjoyable ways.\\n\\nHowever, there were some issues in terms of the actual gameplay + visual language of enemies that really soured the whole experience for me.\\n\\n[h1] The Bad [/h1] \\n\\nThe game plays a lot like a roguelike version of Maplestory (Side-scrolling/Platforming/Mobbing/Hack n Slash) and it is honestly super satisfying to have a character that can cut through huge mobs like butter; however, Skul punishes you for \"bad\" gameplay in a way that often feels unfair.\\n\\nVisually keeping track of the numerous enemies, especially when they are stacked on top of each other, is often impossible or very hard to do. You will be sometimes hit by a ranged character or a teleporting melee character with no idea what happened because the enemy\\'s model is hidden behind 5 other enemies. This is mostly in reference to the \"assassin\" mob that runs back and forth and stabs you.\\n\\nAdditionally, the visual language of ranged mobs is often confusing or unintuitive. Ranged mobs will often charge their attack (fire wizards, golden orb priests, ice wizards...forgive the names idk the actual names) and fire them after a short delay.\\n\\nIn most games of this type, enemies who charge these attacks will indicate when they are \"charging\" and when their attack is \"live\" or \"dangerous\". Skul does not do this consistently. Rather, enemies in Skul will indicate they are charging by having their projectile \"growing/powering up\" by their model. This \"growing/powering up\" projectile will often look exactly the same as the \"live/dangeous\" version of the projectile. The only way to really know whether or not a projectile of this type is dangerous is to closely know the time it takes for them to finish charging; otherwise, approaching an enemy charging is a gamble whether the enemy will fire it point blank in your face or if the charging projectile is safe to touch.\\n\\nThis is really important to me because often you will be fighting with 10-50 enemies on your screen and you will need to react reflexively based on the visuals/feel. You won\\'t always be able to just jump away until the ranged enemy is finished firing. So when you get hit by these projectiles, it doesn\\'t feel like you were punished for not respecting the enemy\\'s attack, but rather, it feels like you were cheated out of your HP because you didn\\'t see the moment that mob started charging his attack to subconsciously time it.\\n\\nIn the roguelikes I mentioned above, if you see a projectile on your screen, it is consistently dangerous regardless of whether it is waiting to be fired or fired (example: Bookllet mobs in Enter the Gungeon will surround themselves with projectiles before firing them in their signature attack, but they will still damage the character if you touch them while they are charging).\\n\\nThis criticism may garner a \"git gud\" comment, but I\\'ve seen Skul differentiate between ranged projectiles/attacks and charge time well on other enemies (archers displaying a laser while charging up and firing the arrow projectile after a delay or green trees highlighting the floor pink where their green spikes will appear). In my opinion, the visual language of these attacks are more intuitive and differentiate between charge vs. attack much clearer (contrasting colors between actions) than what I\\'ve mentioned above. \\n\\n[h1] The Conclusion [/h1] \\n\\nOther than the visual language, the game is aesthetically-pleasing and very fun! Just these moments of feeling \"cheated\" really soured my experience and made me put down the game on numerous occasions. \\n\\nPerhaps, my issue is that I\\'m approaching the game with the mindset of never getting hit and that is where my discontent is coming from. If anyone could recommend a mod that would solve this issue of visual clarity I would love to know about it!\\n\\nIn my opinion, Skul is a very good and fun game with very definite pain points that hurt the overall experience.'},\n",

For example, during the battle with Chimera the screen gets cluttered so quickly with all the DVD acid balls bouncing around, the acid raining from the sky, and the enemies falling from the sky. It doesn't help that all these attacks are purple on a purple background. Also, if you try to use a full map attack quintessence with an animation, that adds even more clutter for the fight.\\n3 I really don't like how each mini boss is just adding on more 'adventurers' or making them stronger for the final time you fight them.

The music at first I thought was actually kinda good, but it gets way to repetitive after having to replay the first world over and over each play-through. I love roguelike games but the game decides if you have a good run and not as much as you. You don't really improve in this game, enemies get free hits on you because many of them stack ontop of one another, or have aoe moves that you either have to just wait till they're done attacking or you touch them because your attacking enemies. The perma upgrades are almost meaningless and require so much grinding to get anywhere with it. The combat is where this game shines, but thats about it. Rng decides if you get good skulls cause believe me, there's plenty of bad ones and meaningless ones. Some higher rarity skulls don't even stand up to some of the more common ones just because rng gave you a bad moveset along with it. Bosses along with mini bosses suck and I have no idea how some people actually like them. The mini bosses feel like a gimmick, and some of them teleport or float. Some of the skulls you find don't even have moves that can hit floating enemies so they absolutely suck for boss fights, but rng decides what skulls you'll find in a run soooo... Dialog feels foreign or at least meaningless to me. I wanted to like this game because the skulls just seem super cool, and some really do. You can have god runs but more often then not you die before you get to the first main boss, and he even has ways to get free hits on you.

Devs have refused to add a hold-to-attack option despite widespread cries for it on release, so you will be constantly wincing as you punish your mouse or attack button. Can\\'t jive with a game that asks you to to shorten the lifespan of your own equipment.\\n\\n-My biggest turn-off: It\\'s unbelievably grindy in every aspect; currency farming, permanent upgrades (which you need to make any progress at all),  and ESPECIALLY enemy and boss HP. Once you reliably get past the 2nd boss (which likely won\\'t happen before the 10-15 hour mark or more without rookie mode) then everything becomes a hit sponge and you and the enemies are stuck whittling away at each other.\\n\\n-Add to that because it\\'s worth focusing on: bosses are unbalanced. Huge HP pools, repetitive yet almost undodgable attacks (1-2 per boss after the first biome), and no variance on them run-over-run.\\n\\n-There are variable minibosses which is cool, but the fact that every biome you just get spammed with more of them simultaneously is dry.\\n\\n-Visibility: The devs balanced/designed the game so that so much stuff is on the screen at one time, be it enemies or particle effects, that dodging becomes kind of an afterthought. The z-axis is a mess, and clumped enemies or effects always hide something else that\\'s about to take a chunk out of your HP.\\n\\n-Low replayability incentive: Sure you can grind (like everything else in the game) achievements, cosmetic upgrades etc. but there\\'s no real loop once you beat the story.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n+Art is gorgeous. It\\'s not often I ogle the backgrounds of a sidescroller but I sure did here.\\n\\n+Items and Skulls are varied, but poorly balanced across the board.

Just not enough to overweight the fairly large weak points.\\n\\nLets start off with the good points :\\n- The game looks and sounds good\\n- For what it's worth, the story is serviceable and the characters are good\\n- The basic movement and dodging is fairly enjoyable\\n- The skull system of basically having 2 classes you can switch between at almost any time is, at its core, a really awesome idea. It brings a lot of flavour to runs and upgrading a skull over a run can feel very good.\\n- The extra difficult game mode seems quite interesting\\n\\nAs for the weak points :\\n- Late in the run, the screen can become incredibly cluttered which is the sort of difficulty that doesn't feel good. Especially with enemy sprites being displayed behind SFXs. Do explosions look cool ? Yeah. Does it feel good to be hit by stuff that wasn't even visible ? No.\\n- Loot RNG is poorly handled : This is a roguelite. RNG is not only expected, it's part of what gives such games their flavour. [i]However[/i] this game has a 9 items cap, which is not necessarily bad in and off itself, especially considering the clutter issues. The problem is that you very often end up getting a choice of items, none of which are upgrades, which you then have to simply abandon on the wayside. This feels absolutely atrocious and [i]will[/i] gimp your runs. You do get a permanent upgrade to get some money when you destroy the trash items. Sadly, it's one of the very last upgrades you can unlock, making the early game more miserable than it has to be.\\n- Skulls are not created equal. Not by a long shot. Lower rarity skulls may need to be upgraded multiple times over the run to start getting good and/or not boring. They may just be plain bad. Or you may simply not have the RNG to get the good active skill on that skull. And the only way to find out is to go all in, pour resources into something that isn't enjoyable for the time being, but may turn out to be great, or not. Which isn't helped by the fact that runs in this game are fairly long. Add to this that, unlike other roguelites, picking archetypes is an ongoing process throughout the run rather than a choice made at the start (like picking a ship in FTL, a survivor in RoR or a weapon in Hades), and you get into situation where picking something bad doesn't just risk a random run. It risks the run you have already spent over half an hour on and on which you managed to have a good thing going. This is not at all conducive to trying things out, which is really unfortunate. Can you look up things online ? Sure, but trying things and finding what fits [i]you[/i] is kind of the point of this sort of system.\\n\\nSo, is this game worth it ? \\nAs things stand I don't think I can recommend it, but I'm sure some people will be able to enjoy the hell out of it.\\nHonestly, just giving the ability to sell items from the start would make the initial push to get the first clear much more enjoyable. And this would be enough to make it a game you can play for a very enjoyable 15-20h. Considering this game's price, this would be a very good deal.\\n\\nHowever, taking this game to the level of truly great roguelites would, I feel, require more profound changes that I don't think would fit in a patch or 2. Still, this game has some really interesting ideas. If progression in a run felt better and gameplay was polished enough to be spot-on, I could see a sequel getting to this sort of level.\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"I love the concept of Skul, but there's simultaneously not enough variety and too much randomness. Each area only has a handful of rooms that seem to always use the same enemy placements, so you start getting a sense of deja vu after only a few runs. Bosses have absolutely massive amounts of health that can take ages to get through if you're unlucky and don't get the right drops, and the minibosses actively prolong fights that aren't that interesting by using healing skills at every opportunity. One miniboss in particular has attacks that are almost trivially easy to dodge, but she follows each one of them up with several seconds of healing. It's awful. \\n\\nAs for there being too much randomness, skull rooms and treasure rooms only drop one totally random item, which may or may not be something that's at all helpful to you. There are shops twice on each level that expand this to three items and one skull, but even with that it's hard to plan a build. Sometimes you get a ton of physical attack items and then the only good skull that ever shows up is magic. Sometimes you get items that don't stack. There's no sense of being able to plan a build here like there was in Hades or Dead Cells. \\n\\nI really wanted to love this game, but I'm already tired of repeating content after all of 3 hours.

       "  'Review Content': \"While it is a gorgeous game with an amazing premise, it feels like the developers have never built a roguelite or played one either. The game is fun your first run but the flaws start showing up around the time you encounter the first real boss of the game, the Ent King. First of all hes a rough fight that can pretty much 4 shot you at your base health but with good reads you can deal with it. And then it goes into a phase 2 where it becomes much more problematic. By your 4th run some really glaring flaws start showing up. Your progress gained is both expensive and miniscule. There are NPC's such as the Dryder that you come across that take a resource that is neither permanant nor guaranteed to have enough of by the time you get to her across maybe 30 runs I was only able to use her purchase twice and to my dismay at how costly it is (forfieting every upgrade except the 1 you choose to keep along the way) it is not in fact a permanant upgrade to the class. And a lot of these things start showing up where you grind through and get no returns. \\n\\nIn my 4+ hours of play i was only able to clear through to the second major boss and that was only due in fact to getting lucky and pulling the absolutely busted Arch Lich class which carried my run all the way through and then the second major boss just did absolutely terrifying damage as well as having moves that seem to be unavoidable. This of course could be wrong but after 2 and a half more hours of gaining no progress and never getting to the second area again I was never able to test and see. \\n\\nI know that's the spirit of rougelites to be random and different each run but unfortunately the random factors in this game are run killers to a fault, 70% of the classes are extremely bad and the remaining 30% are cool ideas but dont function due to the lack of a progression system. I feel like the makings of a good game are here, and the ambition is definitely there, the sprites are gorgeous and you dont get many games where you can play as a skeleton (a personal love of mine) but unfortunately its a wait and buy. But considering this game has gone through a long beta before getting to this point with none of these issues being fixed I don't see it getting any better.\\n\\nTL:DR Gorgeous game with great ambition ruined by lack of proper progession system or knowledge of the Rogue-lite genre.\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': 'I picked this game up thinking it would be somewhat similar to Dead Cells, one of my favorite games. I wasn\\'t completely off base with that assumption but this game seriously lacks the polish and balance a game like Dead Cells has.\\n\\nLet\\'s start with the gameplay, as this is the biggest gripe Ive had with the game so far. I\\'ve managed to get past the second boss once, and that was due to getting two legendary skulls in one run and just demolishing everything. Skulls, the game seems to double down on this mechanic and it almost ruins it. In Dead Cells the player has significant freedom in choosing their items, abilities, and how they want to level them up. This allows players to adapt and overcome situations no matter what items they\\'re given, but there are very very few items that guarantee you a win, if any. That\\'s not the case with Skul, certain Skulls are just terrible, Carleon recruit? he literally has a one slash combo in a game that throws hordes of enemies at you. Ent? have fun doing ground pounds when you inevitability get flung off a ledge.\\n\\nIt seems little time was taken to consider how each skul should interact with the world and each other and instead they just tried to make them look as cool as possible. This eventually comes back to bite you in the ass when half the screen is covered by particle effects. The gameplay  is so unrefined on a basic level it makes playing very difficult. There are sections where it is inevitable that you will take damage. There have been times I was sitting wailing on a plant wall just to be hit by magic from slightly offscreen. Or times when I could stunlock certain enemies and other times I couldn\\'t for some unknown reason. It\\'s also extremely difficult to tell what is or isn\\'t hurting you. Taking damage is barely registered outside of your healthbar going down, which just adds another layer of \"What the hell is going on\"\\n\\nLet\\'s talk about the level design, there isn\\'t any. This is some of the laziest level design ive ever seen, and it reinforces the idea that this game was made simply to show off the skulls. Almost every single room is flat with minimal verticality, most enemies will be fought a flat plane. I don\\'t want to keep returning to dead cells but it is the closest comparison. In dead cells environments are dense, with every surface offering the player a means of maneuverability, You can run up a wall and jump over a charging enemy just so slam down on them, and knock them into the wall with your spartan boots or whatever weapon you have. \\n\\nThat\\'s what makes games like Dead Cells so fun and games like this not so much. In Dead Cells the player always has the tools to succeed and do cool stuff, regardless of their items. Skul however is SO reliant on what items you get in order to succeed that 80% of your runs are dead before the second boss. \\n\\nIn short: Skull balance is bad, enemy variation is bad, level variation is bad, enemy telegraphing is bad (Sometimes being too obvious or not obvious enough), RNG is bad.'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"This game is both good and bad. It does so much right yet gets so much wrong. For each good thing the game does theres always one part of it that fails at. \\nGreat gameplay loop. Slowly learning enemies and their attacks felt great when you finally get the hang of it but some enemies are just flat out inconsistent, Take for example the Area 2 archers. Sometimes they gain a shield and jump back firing 2 arrows but when they do this is completely random so if you use an ability that has an animation and they do that well there goes a quarter of your health. \\nFinally beating the boss that killed you 10 times in a row for the first time really does feel like an accomplishment but your reward is laughable. Most of the time the item for completing an area is just a common that will get scrapped anyway. \\nThey skulls each feel unique and play in a very different way which is good and bad. When picking up a skull for a first time and learning all the moves and attack pattern really is fun it starts to wear though since you only get 5 or 6 starting skulls each of which are all physical attack which really can make half the items you pick up totally useless which brings me to the next point. \\nThe inconsistency of builds. No matter what you do your always at the mercy of the rng. Which is common for a rougelite but my god is it rough in this game. Just beat stage 3 final boss with a magic based skull? Heres a common physical attack item that gives you a bonus if you get hit.\\n The items in the game are divided into either physical or magical and so are the skulls with the majority being physical. This can lead to a lot of runs getting wasted to getting one that doesn't benefit your skull.\\nThe artwork in the game is charming and well done, consistently good throughout. \\nThe inputs feel good and responsive. \\nGetting hit though is were the game really fails, hitboxes are sometimes don't feel good from enemy attacks. There is no on hit immunity which towards the late game can be run ending even from full health since the devs gave the late game bosses beams which do damage on every frame. Got hit by a beam because the skull your using is larger than the platform your supposed to stand on? Boom whole health bar try again next time. \\nAll and all its an alright rougelite thats good to be picked up for a few hours but any extended play will really lead to frustration as rng and questionable design choices kill your run for you. With a few tweaks it really could be a great game but in the meantime Id have to recommend something like Hades over this and its not even close. \\n\"},\n",

All map areas are put in a random order, but, they\\'re the exact same maps. Same enemy spawns, same traps, same way to go. Nothing changes, you won\\'t feel a new experience that some games such as Dead Cells give (Due to the randomly generated maps). While this is an indie game, I still have to give them some crap for the bad game/dev decisions. \\n\\n             The Balance Update was a double edged sword, such as some skulls needed buffs were given buffs, and a lot of skulls were remastered in a way that actually somewhat made them worse. (Examples being Reaper, Champion, and Yaksha. Yaksha is actually in a better place, but is now heavily reliant on Skills, Champion can do damage, but his heavy reliance on \"Energy\" makes him lackluster as a Boss Buster. Reaper is a special case, he used to be incredibly good in terms of AoE and DoT effects, but his \"remake\" has been detriment to him. His damage output is a bit better, but most of his abilities are worse, and a good chunk of them require him to be still for a couple seconds when using them, leaving him incredibly susceptible to damage.)\\n               \\n                Another apparent issue are Enemies, most seem recycled (pretty much the EXACT same enemies except re-skinned, with small changes in movesets or effects). Legit the ONLY unique enemy are the Maid enemies in the Tier 2 area, and the Mages from Tier 4. \\n\\n                And don\\'t get me started on the RNG, if you find a skull you like playing that is in the Unique or Legendary tier, good luck getting it again. Cause there\\'s a good chance you won\\'t see it for another couple runs. Now the RNG wouldn\\'t be so crippling if there weren\\'t so many Skulls and items that were so crippling (Even after a good chunk of the \"Balance\" the recent update bought, it hasn\\'t really changed anything, Speed Skulls still run the show, and Balance/Power can\\'t catch up, and it\\'s solely because the ability to dodge damage and be fast is a huge thing for a Rogue Like).\\n\\n               Continuing upon RNG, the rate at which you get healed, the items you receive, it all varies based on RNG. There are some items you\\'ll get that would\\'ve been great early on, but are completely useless in the late game. An example is the Forbidden blade. If you get it too late in the game, it\\'s just a useless stick, but if you get it early on and manage to actually upgrade it, it\\'s one of the best Physical items in the game.\\n\\n               If they fix some of these issues, I feel like this game could be insanely good to play, but until then it gets boring after beating the game once.\\n\\n(Edit:) I realize now looking back at the RNG aspect for items, and using the Forbidden Blade as a reference was incredibly stupid, I think a better way to put it is the fact you\\'ll get Common tier items way to easily in the later areas, where you already have Rare, Unique, and sometimes even Legendary items.'},\n",

I purchased it in March 2022, and by that time some adjustments had been made to the characters and game items, but they were still not up to par. There are a lot of items whose effects are unknown after being dismantled, and the difficulty level of the game cannot be balanced with the strength of the game items.\\n  “At the time, I reviewed this game: The game is too random.  After each level, you get items.  The strength of these items varies, some are good and some are bad.  Some characters have transformed, but essentially, they have the same strength.  If there are no good characters, it’s almost impossible to clear the second level, even in beginner mode. So far, the game development team has not designed weapons to be used after disassembly. Some special skulls require close combat, but there aren’t many damage reduction items in the game design.”\\n   \\n By the end of 2023, the game has undergone two years of updates and is basically complete. However, the game still has some shortcomings, which prevent players from reaching the ending.\\n  This game is a  Roguelike game, but the game developers may have forgotten the genre of the game.  The overly long game levels have increased the difficulty of the game, eliminating the majority of players who support this game.\\n  Why doesn’t the game increase the bone meal at the beginning when the difficulty is so high in the later stages?  The special items in the game’s Black Mirror mode are discarded by players because they can hardly deal any damage.  I hope the game company will reconsider the design of the game items.\\n[spoiler]The real ending of this game, even if you play with cheats, it takes more than 90 minutes to complete once.  \\n U =  Roguelike game!

This review kind of went on longer than I expected so I will leave a TL:DR.\\n\\nTL:DR: Fun game, but I feel there\\'s too many negative things. Has potential to be a good, solid roguelike but isn\\'t quite there yet. Needs some balance changes, but until it get\\'s those balance changes I can\\'t recommend this game just yet.\\n\\nThis game is fun, and I really mean that even though I have a few negative things to say about it. The skull system is a cool concept, being able to pick up skulls that have different playstyles and moves is fun and finding those really special skulls based off of other games and media is a great experience. The permanent upgrade system is nice, simple, and easy to understand. I always find myself having enough gems to upgrade something so it keeps progression going at a nice, satisfying pace. \\n\\nThe bosses are cool and it\\'s not too hard to memorize their patterns after fighting them a few times, though some skull types have an easier time dodging their attacks compared to others. What I\\'m not too big of a fan of is the \"mini bosses\" that you fight inbetween the big bosses. The first one you fight isn\\'t too bad because it\\'s only one mini boss, but the next mini boss you will fight two at the same time, then the third time you fight them is 3 at a time. It sort of gets more and more hectic as time goes on, and they\\'re not synced up some you may be trying to dodge multiple \"ultimate\" attacks at a time. This often leads to me either just tanking the hits so I can get damage done to the enemies or drag out the fight for long periods trying to dodge all of the attacks. I feel that if the mini bosses were more in sync it would be easier to see patterns and fight more effectively. \\n\\nWhile the skull system is cool there are often times where I find a skull that I like early game only for it to be constantly under powered because I seem to never have enough bones to upgrade it. Every time I have the option to go to a room that has a skull drop I always go to it just so I can get more bones so I can upgrade the skull I have but even then I\\'m always lacking bones to upgrade with. I always seem to be just 5-10 bones away from upgrading. Most, if not all, of my good runs have been because a higher tier skull had dropped early game that allowed me to focus less on getting bones and focus more on getting items to buff my character with. There have also been times where a higher tier skull has dropped early game only for me to still go to every skull drop room for bones and I still not have enough bones to upgrade with. Upgrading skulls has usually come down to the point where it\\'s nearly impossible for me to upgrade unless some higher tier skulls drop and I for some reason choose to dismantle the higher tier skull for bones instead of switching skulls for the obviously higher tiered, more powerful one. It can create some pretty frustrating experiences from time to time. \\n\\nAnd with talking about the skulls, I feel like some skull types are just plain better than others. Speed types seem to always lead to good runs for me since they\\'re faster and usually can dish out a lot of damage. I especially like the thief skull since if I get the chance to upgrade it it can really start doing damage and can clear groups of enemies. On the other hand I feel that power type skulls just don\\'t have enough benefits to warrant playing them. I find it sad because I find that the power skulls are more fun for me to play. They\\'re what you expect, their attacks are slow but they hit hard. They\\'re also slow, taking away one of your two dashes but your dash does (negligible) damage. Since they\\'re slow and you only get one short dash it makes it more difficult to dodge attacks meaning you get hit more. While it\\'s possible to dodge every attack I\\'m more talking about sub-optimal play, the average player isn\\'t going to play perfectly. So even though I like playing power types I often gravitate towards speed types because it\\'s not too hard to make them do more damage than power types, they\\'re fast, and I still get to keep my two dashes. So why should I play power types if speed types can do more damage, move faster, keep my two dashes, and ultimately make it easier to dodge attacks? \\n\\nNow I will talk about the maps. I like them design \"look\" wise, though most of the time you will be too focused on fighting enemies to even pay attention to it. Some rooms are difficult and some are easy, so no complaints there, there seems to be a decent balance. Though I will talk about some rooms where it\\'s just throw as many enemies at you as possible and as soon as you kill a pack of enemies another one just spawns in it\\'s place. These are the rooms where I end up losing the most life just because the sheer number of enemies makes it difficult to dodge all of the attacks. And it goes on for a long time, you will sit there mowing down enemies for whole minutes with no end in sight. There are also some rooms where the pace of the game just grinds down to a crawl where you just have to sit there patiently, or grab some water or food, make on omelet, read a book, learn a new skill, find a new hobby, and wait for the enemy to finish doing their thing so you can go attack them and hopefully kill them before they do their attack in which you back off and repeat the cycle(obviously an over-exaggeration, but you get the idea). Some rooms, but not often, have questionable trap placement where the option is to either get hit by an enemy\\'s attack or dodge the attack and get hit by the trap, or the third option to run away and wait for them to do their thing and attack when they are done. Sometimes there is no third option.\\n\\nAll in all, this review was wrote with the point of view of a normal run. There are items you can get that greatly help your character and there are times that you hardly get any items that help your character out. The normal run I am referring to is the run where you get both items that help your character type and those that don\\'t. Obviously there are scenarios where you get great items and skulls, but there\\'s also an equal number of runs where you just get a lot of items that don\\'t help your skulls. I\\'m reviewing the \"middle ground\".\\n\\nUltimately, I have to choose whether I will recommend this game or not and I wish there was an option to give it a more mixed recommendation. But, I\\'m not going to recommend this game. I originally recommended it, but upon further thinking I decided to change my opinion. This game has potential, but I feel that it isn\\'t quite there yet. Needs some balance changes, and until it get\\'s those balance changes, I can\\'t recommend this game just yet. I might update my review if changes happen, but no guarantee.'},\n",

Even in 20+ runs you might be lucky to scrape together something that would barely resemble \"a build\", let alone something that actually fits your current skull(s). Of course randomness is part of the genre, but I feel like Hades (and Monster Train, and Nova Drift) had these balanced out a lot better. A lot of the runs just end up with trying to make the best of all the random thrash that\\'s thrown at you.\\n* Speaking of thrash, boss rewards are crap 9/10 times.\\n* The mini bosses are badly balanced. The sword fighter is annoying as hell, while the other ones are a cakewalk.\\n** The upgraded version you encounter in the 4th area is a nice challenging improvement though.\\n* The later fights with 2-3 of the mini-bosses together are, in my eyes, a classical mix-up of confusing \"annoying\" with \"challenging\". There\\'s usually way too much going on to have any idea what target to focus without getting blasted to pieces. It\\'s too much of a chaotic mess for my taste. You could play it safe and keep your distance, but that just completely kills the pacing of the game. If they have the priestess on the team expect to double the time required to grind out these fights.\\n** Some of the other fights also suffer from \"too much crap on the screen to see what\\'s going on\".\\n* \"Go to title screen\" not only does what it says on the tin... it also restarts your current run. That was quite a surprise when all I wanted to try was to see if my controller did reconnect.\\n* The grind is long an lacking in progression. You have some permanent upgrades with the traits, but I feel like their impact is too low to effectively aid you long-term in actually finishing the game. After upgrading most traits (which are quite limited) you can only keep banging you head against the wall until you might get that \"perfect run\".\\n* Bunch of minor issues regarding timing and balancing in a some of the fights, but this list is already too long.\\n\\nAll in all there\\'s too much lacking in design, balance and progression for my taste. The inscriptions give some nice theoretical combinations, but there\\'s nowhere close too any option available to allow for any consistency in a run (I found Slay the Spire suffered from the same problem). I wouldn\\'t mind being able to pay 200-500 gold to actually delete an item from the current run (I destroyed a lot of item rewards, only for them to show up in the shop again ffs). I think this is overall the biggest downside, there\\'s just too much randomness to allow for any form of control for the player over their progression during a run. For example, Hades limited the amount of Olympians to four per run (with some exceptions), which allowed for at least some consistency in building up your progression. I feel like Skul just ends up too often with trying to deal with the mess you\\'re being dealt for the entirety of a run.\\n\\nAnyhow, I would say you still give this game a fair try, since this entire rant is highly subjective and just one opinion among many. I just wouldn\\'t recommend it above the (many) alternatives.\\n\\nGuess I\\'ll give Dead Cells another try.'},\n",

A little on the easy side, once you got all the upgrades and mastered the various skulls, but fun and engaging. The new updates have completely broken the game balance, though, and it's now an utter slog. Even fully upgraded, unless you get an astoundingly broken combination of skulls, items, and quintessence, you just can't break through the wall of HP the game throws at you in the last two levels.\\n\\nEnemies take a minute or more even just pounding away at them with constant attacks, and some rooms throw dozens at a time at you, making it impossible to read or predict enemy attacks to dodge them, and all but the most basic grunts can't be hitstunned, forcing you to play in the most passive, cautious, and boring way to avoid simply being destroyed before you can slowly chip down their health bars. Especially offensive are the last few bosses - the final miniboss, a powered-up version of one of the hero trainees you've fought before, can't be interrupted at all, attacks constantly with difficult to dodge attacks that render all but your basic hit too dangerous to use, and has so much health that even room-clearing super attacks do about 5% damage to its health bar. It's just absurd and I have no idea how this got past the testing stage. Nobody could play this and think it was okay.\\n\\nI was beating the game on a regular basis before the updates, and now I can't even imagine getting past the second to last boss even with a powerful setup, much less winning a run. If you're going to have the challenge curve ramp up that high, you have have HAVE to give the player chances to break the game with powerups and abilities, the way Isaac does, but instead the new updates actually NERFED the player, lowering your power gain, especially from Quintessences. I don't think I'll be playing it anymore unless the devs come up with a balance patch to fix the mess they've made of an otherwise fun and promising game. The time played  you see at the top of my review is a little inflated from me leaving it running overnight at times, but I still played a lot of it and enjoyed my time with it before the devs ruined their own work. It's disappointing and sad, and I feel like I've had something good taken from me.\\n\\nUPDATE: Well, I decided to come back after a long time without trying the game to see if anything had really been fixed, and it doesn't much feel like it has. The devs don't really seem interested in paying attention to what appear to be very consistent complaints that are extremely easy to fix: enemy HP too high, weak skulls too weak, RNG too important and punishing, etc. It doesn't really bother me now because there are so many better games of this type to have fun with.

This is made worse with the RNG. Skul is a roguelite that is a roguelite where you're strengths and abilities are largely dependent on the skulls you pickup in the game (hence the name).

Some are seriously powerful and fun like the Grim reaper, Rock star (yes you can be a rock star), lich, berserker etc. but a lot of the others are kinda meh. If you don't get the good ones your run is kinda fucked. You might have to grind a lot improve your base stats/abilities through the meta progression to mitigate the RNG. THe clarity issues can also be pretty annoying and makes the dodging even harder.

Alot of rogue likes have rng, but ive never really had that much of a struggle getting a fun mix of items before. Then there is the skulls where you sometimes get a legend skull, and this changes a run significantly. I dont have a problem with the common or more rare skulls personally, but the common skulls are a real pain to upgrade. Going through only skull rooms and the first 3 major boss fights (not the rooms where you fight the heroes) I still haven't been able to upgrade a common skull to max.

Good luck targeting anything.\\n\\nJust not my kind of game. EXTREMELY repetitive and slow with very FEW options. Its all a game of chance and death. You cannot really grind or avoid boss battles, you're forced to progress and DIE. If you're the type who prefers the grind THEN the boss battle, this isn't you're game. the game WANTS YOU TO DIE. the point of the game is progress, gain stones, die, use stones to upgrade and start over (yes including boss battles). You don't acquire these stones quickly or easily I might add dragging out the game beyond whats necessary. Its like turning back the clock and starting over, but keeping EXP. Interesting concept, and interesting story. You cannot really choose skulls, you're presented with random skulls which makes it difficult to progress because the game is very random and not forgiving. You cannot really target specific skulls or skills. Its a constant mixed bag of gambling and even with a maxxed out character, its possible to lose if random chance wasn't on your side that day.  Healing is rare and there are no potions. Start out on rookie mode, and you'll get a buff that looks like a skull with a pacifier (kind of interesting way to insult the player)?\\n\\nIs the game fun? It definitely can be. Acquiring the Grim Reaper skull makes the game a blast and allows actual progression. I was able to reach the very last boss battle and it can be pretty OP if you have the right addons (which are also a game of chance and cannot be targeted). I wish the game devs thought about making the default Skul upgradeable to the Grim Reaper upon acquring 150 bone fragments or something. I bought the game, and I'll see it through to the end, but the completely random and gambling nature of the game is a turn off. Getting constantly jacked by not having the best of luck is extremely frustrating with no benefit. Some people actually like to play the game, learn, target specifics, and play their way rather than gamble their way through the game's casino style methods and hope they make it out in the end.\\n\\nIs the game worth the money? Yeah, I'd say it is, just be aware of the kind of game it is. Otherwise you'll end up with high blood pressure because the game doesn't want to challenge you, it wants you to die.\"},\n",

It changes the gameplay and you can even evolve characters to get some epic abilities!\\n\\nThe bad side:\\n1. They didn\\'t think much about hitboxes. Spells can hit you even if it doesn\\'t really touch.. And the worst, it hits before it appears. In games like these, precision of timing is the key, yet you get screwed by invisibility, Hurray!\\n\\n2. Too much useless stuff showed on top of everything. One of the ability summons a flag big enough to hide pretty much any character. They didn\\'t think to display the ennemies in priority, no. Instead, you will see that flag, not the mob preparing an attack behind. Same goes for a lot of skills which most of the time, will prevent you from understanding what is coming in your face, specially when there are a lot casted.\\n\\n3. Bad balance. The game is hard and the only thing you should rely on are your own reflexes and skills. Why? The further you advance, the ennemies will get tougher, stronger and nastier. Yet, the items and skills bonuses are not enough to really help. As the ennemies are hitting harder, faster and from every possible angles, your character will struggle to kill some simples mobs.\\n\\n4. Lack of good explanations. Don\\'t be fooled by the skills descriptions, Most of the time, they forget to mention 1 thing. And the worst: some effect or \"reward\" don\\'t apply like its supposed to. Some skills reset themselves upon successful hit (not kill)... Yet it doesn\\'t on bosses... nor even big mobs sometimes.\\n\\n5. Gameplay gets quickly boring. The game is hard and frustrating. You keep going on and on: killing ennemies, then dying, then you see the flaws, then you start over at the castle, and repeat this until you kill the final boss or just decide to do something better of your life. The bad thing about this cycle is... there is really nothing else. As an exemple: Hades. You die so many times, yet there are things to do after death! Like continuing the story, unlocking abilities and facilities. Well, not with this game. You can upgrade your character, but will never really unlock new ability after dying and the story only continue if you succeed.\\n\\n6. Story is boring. Basically, the story continues when you finish for the first time a boss, then you see what could be summarized in 1 line. So not that much details, and obviously, very predictable.'},\n",

This is especially pertinent with the buffed adventurer encounter in act 4. If you\\'re not already an expert at the game and you don\\'t do well enough in an encounter, your run is basically over, so might as well just restart the adventurer encounter/map/boss if you didn\\'t do it well enough. \\n\\nMaking it out of an encounter with around 40HP is basically a death sentence, since you have to play extremely well to recover, and if you\\'re extremely good, you probably aren\\'t beating encounters with 40HP left.\\n\\nIf you\\'re not already amazing at the game, you need to figure out how to make a broken build, which is RNG and youtube videos, basically. I was watching a dark mirror 3 run for tips, and essentially the winning strategy was to get a couple early legendary items, luck out with the slime king to clone a legendary, and then the runner STILL commented on the first hero encounter that he ended up dying around 15% and so had to try again. Amazing. If you\\'re not playing as cheaply as the game is, that would have been 1hr+ just flushed down the toilet, because good luck building the exact same load-out to try again.\\n\\nI don\\'t think there\\'s an item catalog/explanation in the game, but that would be handy, to try things without beating my head against the wall or losing 40+ minutes of run time. When your build is bad, you\\'re basically locked into it if you have all your items/synergies/dark abilities and you\\'re in act 3 or 4.\\n\\nI liked rookie mode to fill out the initial skill tree, and to learn the \"normal\" encounters. Honestly if you could turn it on in the Dark Mirror, I could see myself actually trying to play the game without restarting maps constantly, which gets un-fun pretty quick.\\n\\nIn conclusion, if you\\'re wanting to play this game to have fun, and see all it has to offer, look elsewhere.

Those are:\\n-Very limited hp recovery\\n-Enemies placed in ways which are near impossible to deal with without the right skulls or abilities\\n-Luck being the main thing which determines how well your run goes\\n-Enemies who are unfun to fight\\n-Enemies who make particle effects which clutter too much of the screen\\n\\nNormally I wouldn't complain about these issues but when they're combined it just makes an overall experience which can feel more like a chore than a game,\\nAs an example of all these issues: In the first area there's an enemy who makes a cloud of smoke around themselves which damages you if you enter it but then they're placed on a platform above traps and then unknown to you is protected by another enemy which spawns spikes beneath your feet, this means you jump on the platform to kill the smoke enemy and then see the indicator for the spikes which means you have to then choose between killing the smoke enemy and taking the damage from the spikes or dodging away and hoping the enemy doesn't make the smoke and damage you, you now have to try and not land on the traps before you can then try and kill them again and if you didn't get good skulls before this point your only option is to jump up and try the melee option so if you take damage you're now gonna have a real hard time recovering that hp before a boss.\\n\\nAgain I really love this game but when I have to be really lucky to get a good skull or grind for hours to get some slightly better permanent upgrades to enjoy it it just feels like a slog especially after you've just lost a really good run and know you have to go back to the grind.\"},\n",

The bosses and damage are also a problem, which isn\\'t to say they are/hit too hard, its just you do too little/ the bosses have too much health. even with max passive damage upgrades and an inventory full of damage increasing items, one mini boss took me 10 minutes to kill, simply because I could only whittle away at her health bar and that she had a rage skill that healed her for around 50%.\\n The damage problem, at least in my opinion, seems to come from the fact that items increase stats by percentage rather than a flat value, so when your naturally doing 9-20 damage, not counting crits, a 40% increase really doesn\\'t improve much.\\nThe randomness of items is detrimental to the games experience as well. The ability to switch classes/skills via swamping heads is interesting and fun, but the skills you get with the classes are randomized, making the new class shaky whether it was the previous class you had fun with or if the new skill makes in more detrimental to use.

The class heads dropping at random also seems kinda bad gameplay wise because you cant really choose your setup or experience for the run ahead.\\n I \"would\" say that getting to choose your class/head from the start of your would be more interesting, with maybe a way to unlock the skulls for use back at base, but I do understand that this idea is unruly in a number of ways including having to rework pretty much the majority of the game in order to do so as well as removing/reworking one of the main rouge-light mechanics. (I don\\'t know, maybe this idea is just my personal opinion.)\\nOverall I do like this game alot but playing it often times, in its current state atleast, can be frustrating do to balancing issues. But take everything I write here with a grain of salt as the game is in early access and could change.\\n( P.S. Sorry for the long rant and thank you for your time.)'},\n",

Sad to say that a lot of these indie games just miss the make on so many obvious things. \\n\\nI think Skul has some things going for it. It’s an interesting concept. The item and skull rotation help give freshness to each play. Unfortunately, that’s kind of where the good stuff ends. \\n\\nThe most obvious issue with the game is the lack of an extensive level system. Honestly, there just isn’t enough here for plays to want. A game like this should be stuffed with heaps of abilities and things to unlock. This is what makes a game like Rouge Legacy an A+ game that you can spend a few hundred hours playing.  After 27 hours on Skul, I am just tapped out. I haven’t beat the game yet, but there isn’t really anything new for me to unlock, so I’m just kind of done. \\n\\nThis brings us to the biggest unobvious issue with the game; it lacks any type of tutorial and the game never explains any of the mechanics to the player. Everything I know about Skul I learned for going online and researching, not from playing. This is a huge issue with the game and does ruin a good a bit of the enjoyment. I can’t stress how much this really bothers me. Even at 27 hours in I’m still unsure of some of the game mechanics.  \\n\\nOther things about the game that get annoying is how many hits enemies take as you get to higher levels. Some even have shield generators and those things take about 30 hits to destroy. Then you have regular enemies, not bosses, that can take 40 to 50 hits.  This is just where the game grinds and gets super boring. \\n\\nSo, in the end this game feels very novice and unfinished. It doesn’t feel like the effort from a company that has produced a good game before.  Looking at their game line and I can see they’re not a company with any software to brag about. \\n\\nIf you can get this for free, or under $1, go for it. I wouldn’t spend any more on this one.

The non-boss enemies are punching bags that aren't particularly interesting to fight, and the enemies in each area are merely slightly stronger versions of the same ones in the prior areas. Similarly, there's a variety of mini-bosses, but they're recycled in between areas with you fighting more at the same time in subsequent areas.\\n\\nThe skul concept is relatively fun - you can pick up new skulls to change up your moveset in each run, and they can be upgraded to improve your damage and moves as well, which I appreciate. The artifact system is full of lots of dull stat boosts, though artifacts also have traits that activate if you have enough of the same trait. Unfortunately, there's way too many artifacts and the bonuses aren't enticing enough to attempt to try to do a specific trait build.\\n\\nLastly, the upgrades between runs were something I didn't love either.

This puts me off more than anything else in game, because many runs start bad and I feel like I might as well end the run when I reach stage 2 with crappiest skulls that lack AoE and/or mobility.\\n[*] Most skulls are aimed for single target damage (they have low/no AoE), but starting 2nd level of the game, you get swarmed by enemies. That means you'll likely get destroyed unless you take the game VERY slow.\\n[*] Upgrade system does not address the 2 problems above, so you rely on getting rare-ish upgrades or good skulls for a successful run.\\n[/list]\\n\\nStages get repetitive fast for a roguelike.

       "  'Review Content': \"Ok look. I like this game but can not honestly recommend it. Not right now. First things first, the game has a few major balance issues with enemies and the skulls you can get. All of them are fun except for the couple that are borderline useless but the most powerful and use full skulls are the shield skull, since he can let you take more damage, the alchemist for his passive and the archlich for his passive. Now that doesn't mean they will win you the game but they are the easiest to use because of how this game swarms you with enemies.\\n\\nSpeaking of enemies, more enemies doesn't mean harder. It can just get to be annoying. For example There are several rooms where it drops you into a room where the entire floor below you is just covered in enemies. It can put you in a situation where you are losing health for no reason other than the amount of enemies around you. Then there are the maids. Look, I just wish they had a little less health or make it so you could have a few more options to deal with them since they are a spawner basically. \\n\\nLook, I know this game can be great and its fun but the big thing is you just need to make a few tweaks and polish it up. I also do know new content is coming and I am super excited for it but please, if you read this, please do give up on this. It is fun and has a lot of potential, So yeah, good luck.\\n\\nEdit: Oh! My! Bloody! God!\\nFirst of, this is the full release? This is how the game is meant to be? Great. Fuck anyone who is trying to get into these types of games. I at least like these types and oh boy do I still not recommend it to veterans of the genre unless they are masochistic.\\n\\nSo to start, let's give the devs some credit. The awaken mechanic is decent. I like the thought put in but there are some issues that I will cover later. I also love the cut scenes. They look amazing and I love the little extra character they add to the world. The random skeletons are also a great touch. I also love the new Yggdrasil fight. The old one was way to slow and repetitive so good job. Oh and the fact that you can tell if an enemy is stun resistant is great.\\n\\nNow for the reasons why I edited this and still don't recommend this game. It feels like you took a step forward and then jumped a mile backwards. First off, why did you think buckling down on the idea that more enemies is a good idea. Filling a room with 30 knights doesn't make it good, just boring and repetitive and the outline that shows they won't be can get covered by other enemies. It feels like some of the damage isn't the players fault and that is a major mood killer for games like this. If a player feels like they are being punished for playing, then they won't play. Also I found a bug that the ninja enemy's attack comes out before the attack animation happens. Also, let's touch on the awakening problem before I forget. Why does it cost so much just to awaken any skull? You get around 10 bones from one that costs 30 to upgrade so why not just let it be half?\\n\\nIf this game gets more love and attention and you fix the enemy problems, I might recommend this game. I just wouldn't recommend it in its current form. Thanks for reading.\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': '---- update after another 10h in, and beating the game ---------------\\nI stand by my original review, i beat the final boss with the starting character just for that stupid achievement, game is fun once you hit the end game and have a full understanding, to get there is stupid, the game dosent explain anything to players and gives unfair advantages to enemies, so many of the bosses will hit you mid air before you even attack and they wont signal the attack, so just dash randomly? they can also heal every 10s, the player cannot, so much fun to kill a boss and having to do 3x its hp bar because for half the fight it just sits there sucking on a hp potion, game could be good but the mechanics bring it down\\n\\nI really wanted to like this game, Playd 6h in the first day.  This game is just a RNG grind fest. What i mean by that is, its impossible to beat the game on your first save file, you have to invest gems in to upgrades that honestly they should give you from the start. Such as increasing magic damage by 60%, disenchanting unwanted items for gold. Things that are only in there to make artifical sense of progression in the game. I love old arcade style games where you have 1 shot to beat it, no lives, like spelunky, or metal gear, but this game is nothing like that. just grinding and RNG on top of that to make for a \"fun \" experinece.\\n\\nThe skulls/ different characters are fun but frustrating. You are relying on luck for the character you want, then more luck for the right gear to appear, then even more luck to have enough gold to buy it in the shops. This isnt skill, its just playing the game enough until you get a good run.\\n\\nThe bosses ( i have yet to beat the game just reviewing the first 2 mini bosses and 2 real bosses)\\nI was excited to see such a vast variation in the first mini boss. Theres 3 or 4 different ones you can run in to, Their attack styles varry. one stays in the air the whole time making it jump attacks only, this really sucks depending on your character, another one movers super fast and teleport attacks, bad for slow tanky builds, so more rng for what bosses your run in to can really end your run fast or not.\\nThe first boss i was extreamly dissapointed in, i have already memorized its attack patterns and have achieved a flawless vicotry and the achievement for it. This boss is not fun, its tiring. its two different attacks it has before it ults gets boring fast.\\nFor the 2nd mini boss i was expecting a new boss, something exciting, were in the castle! whos guarding it?!?! the same mini boss from stage one, but this time its two of them at once. This is horible if you are a glass cannon build. There are points where attacks are un dodgeable and you have to take damage. I have no clue who created this game , but i think it may be their first. a player never wants to deligate when to get it, they want to avoid it all togeather. In later on areas the amount of mobs that spawn feel like a endless wave. you cannot see when emeies are attacking because there are so many stacks of them, so you take damage no matter when, even if your roll, even if you counter ( because counter is only 1 attack, not the 6 when you stand still to counter).\\n\\nThe level design has gotten boring after 9h. The rooms are not random, you will come across the same layout room a couple of times in a run. and many times across your full adventure. This game failes to be random where it needs it most to create actual reply ability. Who cares about all the different characters if i cant pick them, who cares about trying to level them up, when i just upgraded my skull for 30 gems but it sells for 11, like really? why make it so grindy and lucky based. A lot of the levels are coverd in spikes, this sure makes it fun, but dont put them on the roof under a platform of enemies, making it so you have to go up there, then when you try a double jump its too high. This wouldnt be a problem if there was a good way of getting hp back. The other traps in the rooms, such as spiked floors that pop out after walking across them are so creative and havent been done before, but they still fail here with enemies not triggering them, so a mob will be idle on it, not agro on to you because the platform is too small, then when you go to fight him, you either avoid the spikes or his hit, or you can stand back and do nothing. great design.\\n\\nThe controls are ok, and thats to put it nicely. It just feels like your mashing the same attack button then occasionally tapping the trigger for a skill, dosent matter what class you are, they all got 1 attack, 1 air attack and thats pretty much it, unless you get good rng and get a legendary, then they have more movesets, but you never get to learn how to use them, the game is so unforgiving. \\n\\nThings that werent thought out. I feel like some things need to be said, Like entering the settings menu and going back to menu, just puts your cursor back at the top of the exit screen, leave it where it was when entering the next screen, a small thing but a pet peve of mine, if your making the game, work out the small bugs. When in the settings menu, if you want to change volume settings you have to scroll all the way down, even though its on the right? just small things like this that make you scratch your head and think, who thought this through. How come it takes holding Y to change skulls in a room, but in the shop area with the free skull, a single tap of Y changes skulls and then you for ever loose the one you had before swapping, where dose it tell the player this? rip reaper run. How come killing a boss without getting hit and getting hit give the same reward? is that even a reward? or are those items that happen to be there, they arent dependant on your skill, like if you clear a room in good time or without getting hit, there should be rewards, that would make this game less rng based.\\n\\nThe HP System sucks, boss\\'s will stand still and tank all damage and suck on a hp potion like a baby with a pacifier, this is not a good game design idea. There are so many un dogeable attacks during a fight, and theres only 1 way to get hp back, and its freaking rng based again, head to the shop and hope you get lucky with a 30% hp potion for all your coins, if your unlucky its a 1% hp potion. Like really? how many other luck factors are needed for a winning run? no skills with characters to get hp back other than wearwolf landing final hit with a certian skill, you can get 1 hp back. and enemies hit for 10. making that 1 hp the one time you land up the skill corectly to have it be the final blow, feel worthless.\\n\\nOther reviews, I dont understand why this game has such a postive rating, Every review on the store that isnt a meme such as \" has skeletons\" has a cons or a flaws section, and its twice as big as the pros section, I get it, it looks like a awesome game, and the sound track in it sounds amazing the first couple times, but once you get down to it, this isnt a good game, people just want to like it.\\n\\nI wouldnt suggest this game for anyone whos looking to 100% it. its just grinding and rng, the levels are repetitive and the bosses get boring after the 3rd go. Buy dead cells, or spelunky, or Metal slug X'},\n",

Then the next encounter is 2 of them, a little harder but not too bad. But then, you have to fight 3 at once. You can\\'t even use a skill without getting hit by at least one of them, because 3 of them at once means that at least one of them is always going to be attacking you. You can get past them with a strong enough build, but I just think it\\'s insanely boring to lose to these guys because you literally were not OP enough to kill them before you got ganked to death. \\n\\nTL;DR game is not fun because you will never reach the end due to dying over and over and over again because of how impossible it is to survive.'},\n",

See, I started off admiring the art and enjoying the story. \\n\\nI wanted to try all the abilities of what would become my favorite skulls (frost skull, and alchemist, and rock star). Seemed like every skull would be fun to play - but... I dislike power skulls because they're slow pokes and I can barely move them. There is mobility, but whatever helps you dash successfully, or move faster, will yeet you off the platform and cost you life sometimes.\\n\\nLike everybody, I do my best to avoid things, but it's not something you can totally master - because... RNG. Did you get the reaper? congrats - him, and many other skulls, take time to build up. So unless you get lucky fast, your run will suck. You dunno what to do, and what to boost with items and quintessence? Well, buckle up, buddy, cause your time is about to get worse. I basically downgraded to rookie mode simply because I got bored. \\n\\nAlso, it needs more slots - I agree with everyone that says that. Why? you can only build one inscription at a time - and between taking all the bones you can find to power up, and trying to get a meagre sum to get a roll every now and then, hoping you'll get lucky - it becomes hard to gauge what will help you fast, and it takes way too many runs for me to figure it out. That's without mentioning making a magic build, and then getting as rarer items the ones that boost swiftness/physical and so on. \\n\\nI've spent quite a pretty in-game penny just to fail at making the build, so I simply.. gave up.  Sure, a cornucopia of choice is nice, until all your resources are so tiny, and you got so unlucky, that your sole choice is... grinding for a bit more quartz, or restarting.\\n\\nAhh yes, and one of my tiny gripes is... if you want me to reroute just because you do not put enough platforms - and the sole platform to access the upper level is on the left, and I have to take that sole route, on what is an already repetitive game, I will have a bad time. Nobody needs that.\\n\\nThat being said, it's still a really good game if you don't play it to exhaustion - so if you keep your beginner mind, and just enjoy the lovely skulls, and don't really need all the things I find lacking in it, you're good to go.

An example, Oberon, the fairy king, often gets stuck on the map and quite frankly, useless in my run.

As for storyline, don't anticipate anything beyond what feels like filler content from my perspective (in total it's around/less than 15 mins only). However, it's important to note that this game heavily relies on RNG, from character/skull selection to getting item. Your run's success or not is up to your luck (and your dodge skill). Furthermore, the game offers minimal dialogue, which, in my opinion, removes characters of their potential uniqueness and individuality.\\n\\nMy overall rating for this game would be 2 out of 5—'not for me' game.

This is mainly an issue in the later stages where the game throws tons of enemies with different attack patterns at you with worthless debris flying around anywhere which combined with your own attacks which create even more screen cluttering effects (which sometimes can look identical to certain enemy attacks for some reason) and also each and every enemy attack taking a pretty significant chunk of your health which all result in you leaving combat thinking you did pretty well with half of your health missing\\n\\n-You are limited to two skulls and 9 items, which can result in you basically being capped at your maximum power level for about a third of an entire run, which sucks when the enemies just get stronger and more damage spongier\\n\\n-On the topic of items, many items feel like they\\'re way too complicated for how little benefit they actually provide.

It seems to have all the check boxes ticked to be the perfect game for me.\\n\\nHowever, the controls feel way too floaty and there isn\\'t a huge depth to the combat: you get swarmed by a bunch of mans and you mash X until they\\'re all dead. From time to time you do a dodge. Mobility-wise your character also feels kind of sluggish, even the more mobile ones, such as the rogue archetype don\\'t feel agile enough to maneuver the stage in an enjoyable manner.\\n\\nThere is a lot of skulls that you can wear and that often changes your gameplay significantly, was what drew me in initially, and it\\'s a very cool concept, but even when playing the more rarer skulls executing cool moves on hordes of mans feels somewhat insignificant. Although, this game does have really nice visuals and nice skull variety. That being said, sometimes you can lose enemies in the background or behind your own character and get hit because of that.\\n\\nI\\'d argue this isn\\'t as much of a game of skill but also a game of itemization and RNG being on your side.\\n\\nI\\'d much more prefer fewer enemies on the screen but with deeper combat, rather than this \"mash X\" fest and do occasional dodge from time to time.

The concept of switching your skull to completely change movesets and playstyle is quite unique and overall i quite like the pace of combat. The pixel art is gorgeous and discovering and upgrading new skulls is quite fun. The item system is not bad but its quite clear some synergies and items are much stronger than others and after a while i found myself chasing the same few items.The story is nothing to write home about,like most roguelikes, but especially after Hades, the bar is quite high. \\n\\nHowever the true test  with these games is when the novelty of new things wears off and you reach the endgame. Unfortunately it is at these moments when the flaws become quite apparent. In my opinion the game has a few major problems. Major chunks and aspects of the game mechanics are way too strong or weak compared to others. Barring a few exceptions the entire class of power skulls are way weaker than the other two classes. To add to this, since most power skulls deal physical damage this makes items that buff physical damage much weaker than items that buff magic damage, even with the recent buff to physical items. When it comes to the items themselves,trying to stack most inscriptions also doesn't feel worthwhile and instead you just go for the items that buff damage or provide defensive bonuses.It is also important to note that as you get to the later stages and get stronger , fights cause too many particle effects on screen and it becomes very hard to keep track of your character which makes visual and audio cues nigh impossible to discern. This adds a layer of artificial difficulty that is just plain annoying. Finally there is no late game content other than trying to find and upgrade all the skulls. After you beat the final boss there are no extra modifiers to unlock for endgame content. \\n\\nI'm sure the devs are aware of the flaws and are working to fix them. When they do and add more content to the game , ill change my recommendation to a yes.\"},\n",

I really enjoyed checking out the different \"skulls\" (classes) and there was definately neat that each playthrough, different skulls end up having different abilities each time.\\n\\nHowever, there\\'s a Huge (personal) flaw for the game that sorta ruins things for me.\\n\\nLuck. LUCK determines how far I progress, not skill. \\n\\nTo give an example, I couldn\\'t beat the first boss for a good bit. However, in a single run, I just \"happened\" to pull good items, with a good skull, which let me DESTROY the boss, no problem whatsoever. Then died 6 seconds into the castle to a regular enemy.\\n\\nNow, the luck thing goes further. Each \"skull\" can be upgraded by giving \"bones\" to an Arachne you discover  periodically through the stages. However, you only get \"Bones\" (as far as I\\'ve discovered so far) by destroying skulls you don\\'t want to use. Now you can \"sometimes\" get grave stages, but again it comes down to Luck as to weither you actually get the room or not. Skulls give you 5 a pop, and skulls cost a minimum of 10, with a max of 30 to upgrade ONCE, then more to upgrade a second time. As of time of posting (getting to the castle once, figure about 7 runs to the first boss), I\\'ve had as little as 5 bones, to a max of 20.\\n\\nSo in short, LUCK determines if you get \"Good\" skulls that you can use (I\\'m sorry, but the first time I use a class and it gets me past the first boss, that is op/luck, and NOT skill.), LUCK determines if you can even upgrade those skulls, and LUCK that you actually get the skull you want WITH the abilities you want, and LUCK to determine you get powerful items.\\n\\nFor me, there\\'s WAY too much luck involved. lUCK kills rouge games, because the idea is, that over time, and player skill, even \"bad\" players can eventually beat the game, as more skilled players can beat it much faster, without the extra item cruches, which is basically bragging rights. With this one however, even with items/stats, without a \"lucky\" skull find, it was Very hard to beat some of the minibosses, let alone the actual bosses. When Luck is what determines if a player can progress or not, it robs the player of feelings of accomplishment, because they know/suspect their win did not come about because of skill, but rather luck. It sorta ruins the genre. However, luck based runs work fantastically for Rouguelike games, as in those player skill hugely matters, but its also known that luck is a huge factor as well.\\n\\nTL;DR, give it a shot yourself, cool game and I won\\'t refund it, as I want to support the developer, but VERY luck driven rather then skill based.

It does not compete creatively with any of the other roguelikes already out, it is very generic and where it is not generic it just copies something from another game. None of this is bad at first, but it does wear on the player.\\n\\nThere is no variation in the levels, so you go in the same order each time - there is no real strong story to go on, random generic wizard has unusual power source, let's stop that, kinda deal.\\n\\nThe skulls are a rough system - the starter skull is very strong, most skulls are a waste of time, forcing you to just stick with your main skull all the time as you use junk skulls as currency (skull fragments) to upgrade existing skulls. You most often can't afford to waste fragments and there aren't other mechanisms to upgrade or gain lots of currency. Some form of permanent upgrade could have fixed this and made the game more fun, as one of its problem is staleness/repetition which is amplified by using the same skulls over and over again until you get lucky.\\n\\nI also found the upgrades relatively weak/expensive, forcing the game to become very grindy to make significant improvements. You'll need thousands to make significant improvements (a single 30% respawn option costs 3000) but each run to start is maybe getting you up to 100. There is some luck involved as every once in awhile you can find rooms that will give you a lot of upgrade points (many hundreds at least) - and if you get past the first boss you can expect maybe 200 area. But literally everything is expensive so you have to do many runs to save anything or waste it on 5-6% increment improvements until you can be good enough to go for the bigger upgrades, which again aren't as significant as their price.

You have to make sure your hitbox doesn\\'t connect to stay safe. So the game teaches you to rely on dashing at the beginning but then punishes you for doing that.\\n\\n* Some enemy attacks\\' timings are very unintuitive. This is made even worse by the fact that bosses have two phases with the second phase have the same attacks but with different timings and added effects.\\n\\n* Cooldowns, cooldowns everywhere! Attacks have cooldowns, dash has cooldown. Even skull swapping has such big cooldown it makes it practically useless. The same goes for item effects and activatable items.\\n\\n* Randomness. \"What? Randomness is why we play rogue-likes!\" True, but in good rogue-likes randomness is both surprising and controllable and allows you to adjust you tactics depending on the situation. This game while having a lot random elements doesn\\'t give you almost any choice. Here are all things you can choose: next room (1 of 2 and half of the rooms doesn\\'t even have the choice!); miniboss reward (1 of 3: skull, essence, passive item, so you can\\'t really plan this aspect); shop item (and most of the time you again have money only for 1 of them and the healing is also a shop item which can even have negative effects!); take or not take a random challenge (see below). So basically most of the time it makes an impression that you have a lot of choices but all of them except one are useless.\\n\\n* Challenges (at least in the first 2 acts) are so hard as if they were an endgame content. To the point that some of them are plain unwinnable with your typical build at this stages. And that\\'s considering I have maxed the permanent attack bonus and invested on some other bits as well. You literally doesn\\'t have enough DPS or HP sometimes. Yes the game have a challenge with unavoidable damage! Fun, isn\\'t it? What\\'s worse is they doesn\\'t even give you any special reward, just the same you can acquire with standard and much safer methods. Moreover you can even acquire legendaries in common rooms!'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': \"The game's combat is really lacking. You can have up to 2 abilites per skull max, and a regular attack, and thats about it. You cannot input a direction on the regular attack so you can hit enemies above more easily, or hit enemies below you while in the air, nothing. \\nEven for a roguelike, this relies way too much on luck. Getting a legendary or unique skull is essential to the run, or atleast getting enough bones to upgrade a different skull. \\nAccessories are boring and basically just stat increases. Even legendary tier items are mostly just stat increases. Whats more interesting about the items is the attributes associated with them, but even then, theres not a lot of them either. Also, there is a limited inventory, for some reason, so you cant get a lot of accessories to increase melee or magic damage, meanwhile enemies become even greater damage sponges. My best run so far was stopped on the fourth boss. It took me well over 5 minutes of constant pummeling at a single one of the two pillars before i got killed, and even then i couldnt destroy it. The enemies get too much health late game, and it becomes unfun, and since you cant keep stacking more and more accessories to help deal with even the small fries in later acts, the enemies become more troublesome to deal with. You can't ignore them either. The game wont allow you to progress until all enemies are killed in a stage.\\nSpeaking of acts, there is no variation. The first act will always be the same forest setting, and with its limited amount of stages, you'll be going through the same, recycled stages each run. Atleast have two different settings per act or something, like how risk of rain 2 has 3 or so different environments for each stage you enter. The gameplay becomes repetitive and boring way too early on. \\nAlso, theres no secret acts in this game, so you dont have much of a choice of what you can do each run, unlike, say, enter the gungeon, which has an optional secret floor hidden on each normal floor, so if you wish, you could always go there. That keeps the game fresh, and replayable. \\nThere are, however, 3 secret rooms (That i've found so far), which you encounter completely randomly, further adding to my point of this game relying too much on luck. One of the rooms has a chest in the middle, which contains a strong accessory, but needs a big key to be unlocked, and around the middle chest, are smaller chests, which contain random rewards or stuff that damages you. Basically, even more RNG. \\nAnother secret room has yet another strong accessory in the middle, but once you activate the room, you have to dodge a ton of darts while destroying some dumb obelisks. Not worth half the time, you'll lose like 50% of your health. Final secret room i've found, is a randomly generated stealth room, where the guards have greater vision than their flashlights would make you believe, or patrol in such a way where its impossible to get past them, due to the way it generated. \\n\\ntldr: Boring combat. Game relies too much on luck, even for a roguelike. Enemies become damage sponges, and the limited inventory further contributes to that problem. Repetitive acts, their setting doesnt vary at all between runs. No secret acts or rooms you can manually get to, so runs are always the exact same half the time. The randomly encountered secret rooms are all not worth it, and are just boring. Items are mostly just stat increases, nothing else, making gathering items boring. \\n\\nI wanted to make this review after i beat the final boss, but the game becomes so painstakingly boring and annoying at the later acts, that im just not bothered to even try to get past the second to last boss.\"},\n",

Unlike it's contemporaries (Hades, Curse of the Dead Gods, Dead Cells etc.) Skull has not spent enough time on making it feel good to hit things - no hit delay, no microstun, nothing like that.

Even in different rooms, enemies appear in similar amounts like ~8 footmen, 2 hammers, 2 crossbows, or 1 fat tree, 1 thorn treant, 1 gas treant, and 8 regular treants. \\n\\nPermanent upgrades are boring things like adding % damage or cooldown bonuses and make the game seem like a grind.

Also, if he has projectiles on screen, they will still kill you even if you kill the boss before they explode, so the boss and player might end up killing each other at the same time before the player can pick up the purple crystals. \\n\\nAll in all its grindy, progression is dependent on luck, and there doesn't seem to be a ton of content in the game.

Oh, and if you do badly, and get hit by enemies on stage 4, you'll start to take even more damage, punishing those who are already struggling. And those are only the minions. If some of the regular enemies are damage sponges, the bosses are full-on damage tanks. Boss fights after the first one become tedious more than challenging.\\n\\nWith all of that, you'll find many builds badly outclassed and unable to compete, especially compared to the best ones. Some skulls are downright awful. That is also if you are lucky enough to get the right items for the right skulls. Out of 9 items, some item inscriptions now require 7 to get the full bonus effect. In turn, with the addition of new items, they are now rarer by virtue of the item pool being expanded. As if all that weren't bad enough, they lowered the partial bonuses for the lower end of the inscription levels. The high end got raised, sure, but now the low end is even worse than it was.\\n\\nOn a completely different note, as you get further in the game, you'll start noticing how easy it is to lose your character.

Honestly, I think what hurts Skul the most is the \"randomly\" \"generated\" part the most. If power-ups/weapons were hand-placed, the worse ones could be a start before graduating to the better ones, and combat encounters could actually feel like combat puzzles more than just a random mass of dudes spawning on a platform. Note that \"randomly\" and \"generated\" are in quotes because I\\'ve seen the exact same setup pop up multiple times, so I suspect it just draws from a library of pre-generated levels and then seeds them with a random selection of enemies.\\n\\nThe spongey enemies is really the worst part, though. None of them are particularly complex, but almost all of them feel like they take just one more hit than they should to allow the gameplay to flow well(and the bosses, oofch, halve their HP, maybe. They don\\'t really have enough stages or tricks to stay fresh through the tiresome amount of HP that they DO have).\\n\\nIt also tries do that thing where you get upgrades for successive runs, but goddamn, you really have to grind for them after the first couple, and they\\'re \"exciting\" upgrades like +4% and +1% boosts.

It's just bread crumbed along with bare minimum to keep you interested. \\n\\nThe game itself isn't all that balanced in quite a few spectrums. \\nSkulls are divided into 2 damage types: Magical and physical. So as you level up you put your points into either physical or magical passive stat bonus. So it's just a roll of the dice if you get a skull that gives you magical or physical attack skills. \\n\\nThere's a feature in this game that allows you to upgrade your current skull by breaking down other skulls, which is neat, but implemented poorly. To upgrade a basic skull it requires 30 bones, which are obtained again by breaking down other skulls that you don't want. Issue is, the amount of bones you get off the other skulls don't amount up to enough to upgrade a basic skull. I've done probably 30-34 runs now and I have yet been able to break down enough skulls to upgrade a single one.\\n\\nHealing you get in this game is trash, you're going to be constantly having no life as a melee character, get hit once  at the beginning of a run and you might as well start over. \\n\\nThe only main source of healing you will get is from a cook pot at certain intervals in the game, which require you to buy them for 400 gold.

There are 35 inscriptions spread over more than hundred items, resulting in lots and lots of combinations. Skul has nine equipment slots, so there are lots of useless items in any run. It's constantly like trying to make an inside straight - theoretically what I need is available, and on a long enough time line I'll get it, but time is linear and I have other things I want to do. Players can refresh the item shop, but it costs money, so refreshing multiple times to fish for the item Skul needs has a good chance to bankrupt the run. \\n\\nI find I spend a lot of time trying to gather just one inscription type, rarely getting what I need, and the run falling apart. The game play loop is not nearly as satisfying as Dead Cells, where every run feels viable because I'm not hamstrung by a random item shop not giving me what I need. Even on higher difficulties where Dead Cells removes healing potions and enhances enemies, it provides the player with more power and items, not less. The game knows it's asking a lot, so it provides the tools.

Skul functions similarly, except the upgrades are minor and take far too much grinding. There are 12 upgrades with only 3 of them being slightly more than meager (\"+6% Magic Damage\"...), uninspired pittance to health and damage.

I want to say one thing about this game though.\\n\\nThe enemies are getting too many buffs.\\n\\nYou aren't really getting any buffs yourself, more like more mechanics to play around with. The game hasn't gotten too hard, but it has certainly gotten very irritating to deal with sometimes.\\n\\nThere are a couple of things that I am a bit sad about for this game.\\n- There are more skills attached to items that make the game chaotic. Most of the time you do not see what's happening due to these effects that make the screen filled with flashes. You used to be able to see when an enemy will attack and such, but with so much going on, you don't know what to expect.\\n\\n- Hero Battles have gotten nearly impossible when a priest is in the battle. The priest will get down to a low enough health, but then heal everyone. This used to be avoided when you could break them out of their special, but now you're not able to due to the buffs these heroes have gotten. Or at least you aren't able to break them that easily. I've gone absolute bonkers on the healer when she prepared her special and she still ends up healing everyone, taking me back to square one. The battles with her are absolutely annoying.\\n\\n- On the upside of items getting their buff, Luck is needed less. However, it didn't decrease by much. You can go through a really good or really bad run and be very annoyed at the fact that it was because of your luck. Don't get me wrong, you can get the worst skulls possible and still make it through. But then those skulls require a lot of physical damage items. Which means you have to get lucky to even get through the barrage of enemies. You will end up mashing a lot, and I do not know if enemies got a defensive buff, but before all this chaotic jazz update with the items, I was able to feel powerful going through enemies. Now i have to keep mashing until they finally die. I feel weak with even Unique Skulls.\\n\\nI do love this game. It's fun, but it used to be simpler and more fun. Now it's chaotic and less fun.\\n\\nHere are recommendations that I think need to happen for this game:\\n- Make a simple mode, I don't like having my items have extra effects that fill my screen up with random stuff.\\n- Make skulls accessible not through the adventure, but through upgrades. This might be a huge change to the game and its factor of luck, but I love certain skulls that are Unique, but have only gotten them once through all the playthroughs of this game.\\n- Make the heroes breakable again, or atleast easier to break. When there's 3 heroes on the screen, I can get through them IF there isn't a priest. The priest heal is ridiculous. It's easier to get through the stage bosses and that says a lot.\\n\\nI've had loads of fun with this game. But its gotten to a point where I feel like the character is always weak. And not in a challenging way. It seems more of a chore to trudge through fodder of enemies that don't take too much damage unless I have the EXACT right items.\\n\\nThe game is a mess right now for me.

The fact that you're losing 95% (5% are NPCs and Dark Quartz) of your loot and progress just isn't very satisfying at all. I would really love to see some checkpoints here and there. For example right after the Ent Lord, because then dying at the stages after and then having to redo the bossfight just doesn't make sense to me.\\n- Secondly (This is just my taste, so it probably won't match everybody's thoughts) I think the Soundtrack for the Carleon Forest stages is very unfitting. By now I kinda got used to it but seeing this absolutely stunning pixelart and then hearing this weird happy EDM-ish music just doesn't match up for me.

It's also got cash grab mobile game progression (meaning painfully slow) though without the pay-not-to-wait features, which I guess makes it better? The graphics are nostalgically charming, but the controls feel like I'm actually playing a very old NES platformer. It also doesn't seem like there's much world to explore. Basically you just do a combat room (and you have to kill all of the enemies to unlock the doors) and then there's a reward and two doors to choose from at the end of the room. The rooms get repetitive very quickly. I'm sure there are more rooms further in the game, but they're so small and they repeat so often that it just makes everything seem even more grindy.\\n\\nClearly some people are really enjoying this game, but I don't see the appeal.

Skulls can be upgraded but the spider-lady only appears after boss fights, meaning if you wanted to upgrade at any point between you're screwed. Top it off with only getting bones (parts to upgrade your skull) by destroying unwanted skulls. You need 100 skulls to get the max upgrade and the average skull gives around 5-11 bones. This doesn't seem like an issue until you realize focusing skull rooms is the only way you'll ever upgrade, meaning you'll be ignoring items and money whilst relying on luck to get the correct room or a rare skull.\\n\\nA successful run relies on getting lucky with skulls and praying you'll get them in time for the next boss, otherwise you're shit out of luck. The type of healing offered is randomized based off what the chef feels like selling, so you could recover anywhere between 15% to 70% hp which only adds to the RNG.\\n\\nIf you value your time and sanity I recommend most other roguelikes unless you really hate yourself.\"},\n",

But there\\'s a few gripes I\\'ve had over time that make it really hard to recommend to players.\\n\\n1) The skulls are, for the most part, pretty limited.\\nI understand making them is probably difficult - you have to make the art, you have to make the attacks, you gotta consider the upgrades for each rank... but there\\'s not THAT many and when you get your hands on most of \\'em, you already know you\\'re not gonna want any others. I\\'ve recycled skulls leagues above the ones I normally use just because I\\'m dedicated to the run and won\\'t find any utility in it - I\\'m just desperately grinding to a Legendary Skull I\\'ll never see. While I\\'d LIKE to say just making new skulls would solve the issue, it probably wouldn\\'t unless ALL the skulls got tweaked/upgraded to some capacity as well. Personally I think either the cost to upgrade skulls down or the amount of shards higher rarities give when you recycle the up would help in the short-term.\\n\\n2) Whatever the hell Area 4\\'s got going on? It\\'s not good.\\nSaid simply, the difficulty of Skul SPIKES here. Not even in the \"haha, get good way,\" the \"if you don\\'t have your extra life and a tanky skull you\\'re just gonna die before you can move on way.\" It\\'s irritating and even the best skulls on the block - ones you\\'ll almost never see or be able to get! - won\\'t be able to make things easier if you happen to deal with some bad RNG. I\\'ve had a good two runs total make it past this area at all and it\\'s by the skin of my damn teeth. Genuinely one of the most frustrating parts of a game I\\'ve ever seen.\\n\\n3) No \\'debug\\' control.\\nThis is a nitpick, but the game would absolutely benefit from an artifact that lets you spawn items, Skulls, or even Quintessences to play around with. There\\'s no point in trying to make a build if the game never lets you get anything to its fullest potential. Maybe this could be an unlockable for finishing the game a certain amount of times, or just finishing at all - and it could disable achievements or whatever so you can\\'t just charge through the game with all these fancy skulls, or whatever...\\n\\n4) My computer is in danger of overheating whenever I play the game.\\nIts performance is astoundingly poor. I don\\'t even know how to fix this, I\\'m not really a computer guy, I just like to play games - but it practically melts trying to cooperate no matter how much I try.\\n\\n-\\n\\nIf these get altered at some point (particularly the second and fourth points) I might change my tune on things, but in its current state I can\\'t bring myself to call this a fun, rewarding game that\\'s worth its price tag.'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': 'An overly difficult and grindy roguelike that is ultimately killed by the RNG of skull drops. I had fun with this game for a while until I realized you do not get viable skulls anywhere close to even an uncommon drop rate. It seems like the skulls you get just about every run are severely low damage skulls with long recovery on animations whose very slight damage increase from the base skull is not worth it. This feeds into the roguelike nature of it which would be fine if stat progression wasn\\'t this slow. You need the dark crystals to pump into damage increases but this stuff drops in very little quantity and in such few rooms that getting enough to actually make a difference on any stat requires multiple runs. Runs in which you get useless skulls meaning your damage is way below what the progression system expects you to have making acquiring crystals that much more difficult. Speaking of sparse currencies; you can get gold which only stays during that run however items and skulls in the pre-boss rooms are so expensive to the point that if you hit only treasure rooms you might have enough for a heal and that\\'s it. You probably won\\'t be able to afford an item to help you and there\\'s no guarantee you can trade in your skull for a new one leaving you maybe at full health and with no benefits going into some rough fights. Now there are characters to recruit to get items or skulls at the beginning however none of the items or skulls you can get before starting a run are of any worth, especially since trading in that skill isn\\'t a guarantee if you make it that far. There is a way to power up skulls however it is not permanent and costs a ton of that crystal currency which means you have to make a choice on upgrading a fairly worthless skull or your stats. All of this combined with the utterly ludicrous damage that enemies can do to you inflates this games artificial difficulty. It\\'s designed to be an unfairly difficult and overly repetitive grind fest where the success of your run is ultimately decided by pure luck. I wanted to like this game after seeing Jirard \"The Completionist\" Khalil show it off during IndieLand 2020 but I really can\\'t stand by these design choices.

But guess what? You eventually progress and new enemies make things a little exciting again! And then... you realize they are just reskinned, harder versions of enemies you have already encountered. Until you run into the maids.\\n\\nArt and animation is excellent. Controls are very tight. Soundtrack is good, but definitely gets VERY repetitive. Quintessence can be very unintuitive, sometimes detrimental, in combat. It functions as a distraction from important dashing and dodging in most cases. Some skulls are so worthless, you are better off with your base abilities just so you can keep the essential ability to quickly dodge and engage enemies by throwing your head (I made it farthest in this game picking up ZERO skulls).\\n\\n*** I think combat can be drastically improved by either lowering the recharge rate on the player\\'s dash, or allowing the player to dash twice before it recharges. Dashing is essential to the defensive gameplay, but feels way too limited.\\n\\nThis is a well made game with some great ideas and I really want to enjoy it. But some design decisions have made it feel repetitive and annoying. I wish there was a 3rd \"Try it first.\" or \"Maybe\" recommendation in Steam for cases like this because it does deserve a look if you are into action roguelikes, but I feel a good number of players will be pushed away by it eventually, whether they like the game or not. \\n\\nThis is a golden age for action roguelikes, and it\\'s an easy recommend for many of them lately.

In other roguelikes you can control the outcome even if RNG is shit. Not in this game, if RNG ain't with you, your run is dead. No amount of skill will fix this. Recommend playing Rogue Legacy or Dead Cells instead and skipping this for now. If tuning comes down the pipeline for the Skul's then it might be worth it.

I didn\\'t make it past the forest - but in there the soundtrack reminds me of a happy game for kids. It\\'s still about killing humans while using undead magic. I had several occasions in which the soundtrack straight annoyed me since it\\'s this happy and redundant doodle diddle.\\n\\nSecondly I can\\'t really understand why developers lock progression behind such a grind. It\\'s hard enough in the beginning to upgrade even a common skull to its next tier. And then that upgrade (which is quite minor) isn\\'t even permanent? Meaning I have to grind bone fragments big time (they are lost after each run) and can\\'t even keep that small upgrade for the next run?\\nDuring the 4h I played I managed to accumulate roughly 300 dark crystals (?) - There are upgrades in this game that need 3000 for the first level (of 10). Surely you will get more crystals as you reach later levels, but am I playing a free to play MMORPG here? It feels like I have to save them to get very small upgrades. For example the physical damage upgrades gives you permanently 6% more damage while every upgrades cost increases. By my calculation this would result in the cost of 1650 crystals for 60% more dmg. Again: I played for 4h and got roughly 300...\\n\\nThird: It felt like the items (for example in the shop that appears after a couple of stages) almost never had properties that matched the items I already collected to the point that it felt like the game doesn\\'t randomize those but doesn\\'t want you to build \"strong\" synergies.\\n\\nAll in all it doesn\\'t feel like a single player that wants me to have fun, but that wants me to play perfectly or grind my ass off for those crystals.

But to put it simply from what I played  nothing is consistent, as in your progress to power through a run is a complete dice roll. \\n\\nThe game feels like a mix between Kid Chameleon, Maple Story, and Dead Cells. You progress through a stage by fighting filler enemies and doing platforming challenges. At the end of a stage you get to choose a door you enter that will have a set reward at the end (except when they decide you only get one option). These rewards include item chests, gold, and most importantly Skulls. Your major source of power is the skull's, which completely changes your play style depending on which skulls you get. Some are magic base, some are melee, some are ranged, some are a mix ect. Some skulls are worse than the skull you start off with, others are INCREDIBLY powerful. You can also power up skulls by using bone fragments at certain times to power up your skulls. Problem is you'll never know if you're going to get those more powerful skulls, and whats worse is that the rarity of the skull decides how many bone fragments you can get. So you have a system where you can't reliably get a rarer skull or bone fragments to upgrade the more basic skulls. So at face value your path to power is luck based and their little you can do about it.\\n\\nBUT WAIT THERE'S MORE. Each skull has a pool of usable abilities, and THOSE too can vary in quality as well. These abilities are important because they provide a lot of damage and utility. The problem again is that some abilities a skull has are much better than others. You can change the abilities by freeing a npc in a cage during the normal rooms, but they are not guaranteed and they are also not guaranteed to change your abilities to ones you like. \\n\\nSo to recap\\nYou roll the dice to see if they give too a good skull\\nYou roll the dice to see if you can get enough bone fragments to upgrade a skull\\nYou roll the dice to see if you get the good abilities \\nYou roll the dice to see if you can roll the dice to change those abilities\\n\\nMaybe the DLC fixes this?

It borrows many gameplay elements from many different games of the rouge lite genre, yet fails to improve on them in any way. There is nothing to teach you the nuances of the gameplay, nothing to show you how the different heads work or what the door designs mean when transitioning levels. The enemies are fine and work well, but the level design of this game is so basic and does not compliment the enemies moves or positioning The graphics look as generic as can be, like they used free assets from Scratch (look it up). The music is bubbly and fun the first time around, but after the 10th time in the same area, listening to the same 8 or 10 notes for 10 minutes can get really annoying. The story is non-existent and as far as I am in the game, I can't see it going anywhere remotely interesting. The dialogue can range from boring to very cringe-worthy, and the characters have as much personality as a wet blanket. Nothing about this game is rewarding, none of the upgrades are fun or helpful, a lot of the heads you get are just lame and not fun to use, and movement in this game is as stiff and weightless as it can get. I can't even recommend you buy this game on sale, it would just be a waste of your money.\\nHOWEVER, thankfully this game is only a rip off of much better games you can play that are much more engaging and entertaining than Skul could ever be.\\nDo you want the movement, combat, exploration and difficulty of Skul except you actually feel like you're playing a real video game? Hollow Knight Babeyyyyyy! It's a souls like metroidvania with beautiful music and art design, amazing boss battles to fight and areas to explore, and on top of that, they don't try to waste your time with some stupid story with horrible characters.\\nDo you want a rogue lite with the upgrades, weapon system, and level traversal that Skul stole? Boom, Hades. You play as Zagreus, son of Hades, escaping from the horrible hell scape his father governs. There are so many upgrades, so many weapons and variants of them, so many characters, so much story to take in, amazing music and boss battles, it's truly incredible. I can't blame Skul from stealing from Hades, it is an amazing game.\\nHow about just a simple boss rush? No run and gun levels, no upgrades, just you and your weapons. Then play Furi. Furi is one of the most simple games I've played and yet it delivers a more fun and rewarding experience than Skul ever wanted to. You have a gun, a sword, and a dash. That's it. Each enemy is so much different than the last, all with their own goals and ambitions. Once you master the combat of Furi, you almost become a boss yourself.\\nI hate to be so negative about this game, because I really did want to like it. But after I reached the final boss of the second area (which is a literal Mantis Lords copy) I've lost all motivation to continue. Maybe I'm just not getting it being too bitter, but I honestly don't understand the appeal of this game when you could just play the games it rips it's mechanics from instead.\"},\n",

Each defeat is frustrating and discouraging, and the normal rouge-lite sense that every run slowly contributes to your building momentum is severely lacking.

No knockback, no satisfying impact sounds, no pulse of screen borders or clear blink of invincibility frames that follow it. Bossfights or packs of enemies feel like standing next to them playing the same sprite animation until their healthbar drains.\\n\\nThe things that hurt you are difficult to see, too. There are no real audio cues for anything that you\\'re fighting that indicates the winding up of an attack or the release of it — or the actual impact, as stated before. Your health just goes down. All you get to read off is whether a small part of their spritework shifts, something that becomes incredibly obscured when the enemy is poisoned or otherwise debuffed. Their models will become monochrome in purple or be hidden behind the pops and splashes of your weapon impacts, hindering the readability of when they are going to swing again. Replace it with overhead icons or a fx that leaks onto the floor, palette-swapping those models hurts it a lot. The layouts and enemy variety is samey and made the experience of going through them to fight the stage boss with their lacking tells again all the worse for it.\\nThe UI of gear choices also lists the type of effects an item has, but not how many you currently have active, and you\\'ll need to open up the description for all the items to see if you had (1/4) or (3/6) of a type for every item. \\n\\nDead Cells might have spoiled me in the field of UX, but I had expected better than this from a game with a 93% positive rating from 38k people.'},\n",

I am no expert though, so i might be wrong, and i will change this review if the dev does something about this matter.\\n\\n1) The ranged skulls are particularly bad. The archer is better than the other 2, but still bad. The fact that you can keep yourself safe is nice, but you can only shoot 1 enemy at a time, and the damage is much worse than melee too. That's why clearing a room with ranged skulls feels really bad and takes much more time.\\n2) Sword/flame/wolf skulls are bad imo. Sword and flame skulls will stand still after you switch them and that's bad. At least the skills of flame skull are good, so it's still usable. Wolf will teleport after switching. Lol, why? Dodging boss's skills? \\n3) Some mid bosses are obviously easier than others. The archer and priest are the easiest. Then the ninja and wizard. The sword one is the most powerful. Haven't got to the final boss of 2nd zone so i am not sure if there are others.\\n4) This game depends a LOT on luck. Something that's bad in this genre. The problem with bosses aside, there is common and rare for everything. Rares are more powerful but of course, less frequent. So if you are lucky and get 2 good and rare skulls and some good items that work with them (items that buff attack based on skull type) , the game will be much easier. I am not saying that without rare stuffs you can't win, but luck shouldn't give you that much of an advantage.\\n5) The cost of later upgrades are just so high that i wonder how long it will take to get them. Too lazy for that grind.\\n\\nThat's basically it. I hope this review gets noticed, because i do want to play more.\"},\n",

Here\\'s why.\\n\\nAction roguelites are about finesse - dodge and weave through enemies finding the right times to strike. Skul tries to appear as such, but in actuality is no more than a dps check. For example, there is a point in every run where you have to fight 3 randomized bosses at the same time. You\\'re going to get hit many times, no exceptions. The only survival is killing them fast enough. \\n\\nThat\\'s the core of the game. Fight a dozen enemies at once each with different attacks, but no matter how well you memorize attack patterns, you cannot focus on dodging any of them without getting hit by the other 11. Not to mention there\\'s no I-frames on hit, so expect to get oneshot by a single attack hitting you multiple times. Game design of each room is cruel and unfun, always forcing you through tight spaces to kill enemies with massive area attacks that pass through walls.\\n\\nWhat\\'s worse is how the game handles a player\\'s power. \"Skulls\" that are the core of your build are either useless or absolutely destroy rooms. Items give you ridiculous attack power, and having that exponential power is required, so if you take any of the few defensive items the game offers you, you lose as soon as you hit a DPS check bossfight. If you happen to make it to the later floors, your strength completely plateaus, since your item total caps at nine. \\n\\nBut no matter how strong your build may be, runs are still hopeless. Even in runs where you mow down enemies effortlessly, the quantity and variety thrown at you force you to take hits. In Skul, there\\'s almost no healing and if you take 10 hits, you\\'re done. What this means is you lose out on the biggest part of roguelites - the feeling of strength and power. You don\\'t get any dopamine from finding a great legendary if you know you\\'re still screwed.\\n\\nHow this game actually has a following is beyond me.\\nAt no point during my 13 hours was the game fun, and I have no interest in wasting my time any longer.\\n\\nDo not buy.'},\n",

But let me give you Skul in a nutshell.\\n\\nSkul: The Hero Slayer is a rogue-light which you play a skeleton man who can pop his head off and pick up new skulls to change class. 90% of the skulls range from terrible to slightly less terrible and only a few are passable in regards to being good enough to get past the second boss.\\n\\nPlaying without cheating and running into a brick wall every time for the second boss, I decided to give my self in cheat engine 100+ bones. Bones are a currency you use in the game to upgrade your class. Now, I thought \"Gee, maybe I can like, try all the classes at max level and see which ones are good and which ones I should just restart the run early.\" - And guess what? Every class except for like, 2 of them, are crap. But the problem with bones is by the time you get enough without cheating, you will be right near the end of the game.\\n\\nSo, let me lay it on you. Skul: The Hero Slayer is pretty much only beatable if you grab a very early legendary skull, such as the Gambler. Now you might say \"Gee, sperg. You might just be bad at video games and terrible\". That could be true! But I think I\\'m not too terrible at video games and even when getting to the end of Sekiro, I still felt like it was challenging, but fair. Skul? Skul is not fair and the insane amount of grinding you need to do in runs to get better passive everlasting bonuses takes way too long. Other rogues such as Binding of Issac, you will feel like you are slightly making progress with every run and unlocking new items. Skul? Skul you will run twenty million times to get a +1% damage bonus. Yippie.\\n\\n You will start off your run - Get something terrible like a shield skull, and you might as well restart until you get something legendary. Let\\'s talk about traits as well. You see, legendary rare skulls are not enough to get ahead in this game, you also need items which provide traits. Traits also range from 99% garbage to a few that are worth picking up and you can only have so many items equipped at once. Traits are leveled by having similar items share the same trait keywords. Say you pick up a rod that has the traits (Lava) and (Gamergirl Pee) - Now, these have a number like 0/5 - If you pick up enough items with (Lava) keyword, you will get a passive effect like fireballs will peridoically shoot out of you and the more you have the trait the lower the cooldown.\\n\\nFor another cheating experiment, I decided to give my self 90000 gold. Now, most levels you will get like, max 2k gold. With all this insane gold, I decided to run the item shop restock over and over to see how long it took me to get the \"fairy spirit\" or whatever trait maxed which I believe to be the best trait in the game currently. Needless to say, I spent all 90000k and was still missing a piece. Oh no!  \\n\\nIf you don\\'t get a really rare skull/trait combo? Well tough cookies, bro. Because now you do about 1 hit per swing and every single enemy in this game is a HP sponge. This gets insanely obnoxious when you get a terrible combo and you legit are spending about twenty minutes just trying to ping down an enemy one floor below you, who\\'s AI isn\\'t good enough to jump up and attempt to attack you.\\n\\nSo, would I recommend Skul? I don\\'t know, man. For a rogue it\\'s actually pretty terrible right now - But! I think with time and a few patches, it could be a great game. Think of this no as a yes after a couple of quality patches and perhaps adding an option to let class upgrades be permanent.'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': 'This game has potential there\\'s no doubt about that. \\n\\nHowever, right off the bat it is too difficult and unforgiving even on the first area. There is no proper way to regain HP or it\\'s too vague because you only get it on some kills from the enemies. The Dash mechanic shouldn\\'t have to be upgraded in order to to deal with enemies. I felt like the difficulty would just spike on some points and I would lose more health from one attack than a similar attack. \\n\\nI only made it to the first boss because the skull I had was the Minotaur which gave me a boost in health and defense and every other skull up until then was mediocre and felt more like a downgrade than an upgrade. The game is too harsh in the beginning and I feel the difficulty at the moment would scare off newer players because it seems like you need to have experience in these types of games to make any progress. There\\'s no fun in dying over and over and only making a bit of progress if you don\\'t even get anything out of it except stronger enemies. \\n\\nI believe one major change should be that the dash should already offer invincibility frames or alternatively make the controls more fluid because they feel so stiff and only certain skulls allow better mobility than others. It makes since that ninja is faster than the Minotaur but it should feel like you have to commit on an action that could\\'ve been changed in a split second. Others may say differently on changes and that already having invincibility frames would make the game too easy as you\\'d just be able to no hit without having a problem. To this regard they say you need to \"get gud,\" however, the difference between this game and hollow Knight is that there was actually a way to avoid enemies and spikes even without the shadow cloak.\\n\\nI believe this game has the potential to be a great game but right now it\\'s too unforgiving and hard even at the start. Even beginners would be put off because it gets to the point where your just trying to get past one point and not trying to enjoy the game. At that point it\\'s no fun and if it\\'s no fun people won\\'t bother.'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': 'This game is fine but overall its not great.  I\\'d put it in the \"okay\" category of games.  Like a solid 7.5 out of 10.  Not worth more then $12. So definitely wait for a sale before getting it.  Plus game still doesn\\'t have a save feature during runs which is just so pathetic and sad.  Unless you are a super skilled speed runner, full runs can take 2 hours, and it\\'d be nice like so many other games to have a save option but instead play like its 1990, no saves and no passwords for progress.\\n\\nOverall I don\\'t recommend it as its not very fun.  This game has a lot of hype, but don\\'t listen to that. It\\'s really just okay.  It is a very frustrating game and the rogue like elements feel tacked on.  Like they made a decent 2d slasher and decided they could make a few more dollars by adding in basic and worthless roguelite elements to it.  A shame because had they focused on making it fun instead it could have been great.\\n\\nBossess and room designs have massive issues.  Some sprites are really ugly, like just pathetic.  And they don\\'t do enough to make this visible as you deal with millions of things on top of each other.  Hitboxes also can be REALLY bad.  Not miles away bad, but clearly visibly it looks like it shouldn\\'t have connected but some invisible frames must continue to exist pre and post to visual colision.\\n\\nStory is like many rogue-lite games not very deep. I\\'ll give some credit here because they at least tried which is more then many others.   \\n\\nIf you need a slash and action heavy game this can fill that itch but not worth long sessions.\\n\\n'},\n",

At least you felt like there was progress in Hades. This is just repeating the same tired ass boring sh*t over and over again praying you got enough of these stupid points to make yourself a little better in hopes of beating whatever destroyed you the first time around. Eventually getting just powerful enough to withstand the beating you\\'ll receive with some lucky crit ending the boss fight.\\n\\n+/- Graphics. Typical pixelated SNES sidescroller. Yea sure, cute for what they are, but seen a trillion times before. For nostalgia\\'s sake they\\'re fun. But I still own a SNES, so this isn\\'t necessary on PC.\\n\\n+/- Music. Bland. Not bland enough for me to instantly feel like eating a Tide pod or drinking boiling water may be fun. But not really memorable. I feel like you\\'re so concentrated on trying to memorize the patterns through muscle memory so hard in this game they could have literally used used fart noises for all the sounds and music and no one would have really noticed much.\\n\\n- Story. This is so boring. Right after the tutorial, I instantly lost any interest in story. I literally skipped every dialogue even during my first play through. To me whatever is written in this game is the equivalent of Jigglypuff\\'s lyrics. Instantly put me to sleep. My family was about to have my last rites read to me pull the plug.(I\\'m sure some of you would love that. lol Keep dreamin\\')\\n\\n- Abilities/Movement/Speed. These abilities suck. I literally had 9 add-ons adding at the very least 15% to my physical attack, in the third form as Werewolf. Let me tell you this, I\\'ve seen people hit vape\\'s harder. Dust landing on a cloud in heaven hits harder than this character ever will. Movement speeds I feel are fair somewhat. But the RNG thrown into this is utterly ridiculous. You might be saying \"What RNG? You said it\\'s memorizing muscle movement\" Now this wouldn\\'t be an issue if you weren\\'t left with the complete b-hole option of getting random abilities. Especially once you save a couple of characters. The Wolf, that witch, and Ogre. The Wolf and Ogre always give you a free ability and skull. But as you guessed it, you will always be given the worst of the worst nonsensical b.s. ability and skull to start. I.E. You will be given a Magic based skull and a physical based ability. Or vice versa. EVERY single time. This has happened in over 30 straight runs. Nothing ever compliments one another. The ENT boss...this is a good example also. Let\\'s say you\\'re not given any skulls up until this that allow your character mobility or a decreased speed. You are not going to beat both phases of this boss. First of all your huge slow crap character cannot move quick enough to dodge that bosses attacks properly. So you\\'re almost guaranteed to be slow enough to take at least some damage on every attack. I get it\\'s supposed to be difficult and it\\'s an achievement in defeating it without damage....my point is you can only do that with certain builds. Actually only maybe 1-3 specific builds. Otherwise there\\'s a good chance of death. This sucks in two respects, it\\'s unbalanced and is a subtle \\'slavery replay\\' Instead of you actually wanting to sit down and grind this out, you feel forced to, even in order to beat the game one time. It\\'s not so much about skill, movement, dodging, etc as it is about getting a lucky build, having all the enemy movements memorized, and knowing the distance of every movement of your character or if you play enough times and get enough points you can make this character so OP you can blow through most everything and eventually beat the game.\\n\\nEither way, I feel like the time invested in this would not be worth it as this point. It\\'s not the most disappointing thing I have ever seen come out of Early Access. But it\\'s not the best either. I can play a run or two before wanting to be a pr*ck to the dead/un-dead.'},\n",

The game has always had several problems with translations/subtitles apparently with various languages, nothing so harmful, until with my first end of the game I unlocked the dark mirror, and on the same day when I  entered into the black  mirror a  bug happens  simply changing  all the layout and subtitles to Russian. So I opened the menu to reverse this nuisance and for some reason next to the option of changing language they putted the  dramatical option of redefining local saves, I naively clicked on it believing that the option asked \"Yes\" or \"No\" to redefine the settings to Portuguese  again but instead of that I ended up deleting my save that had 44 hours of Gameplay and hard work, only being able  to finish  the game once.\\nFirst of all, I tried to check the local saves of the game in the folders so I could rescue the old save, but the game had already done  a New Save Backup, so I went to Reddit and I found some other people with the same case or similar of mine , with that  I concluded that there was no point in researching more trying to save my files so  I ended up not  recovering my save.\\n\\nI leave my non-recommendation to this game not only for what it has caused to me, but also for  neglecting something that should be so simple today. The game even launched on Nintendo Switch and already had a long time since the release date which contributes to the point of being unacceptable to a game as big as Skull Hero to make such a simple mistake las this.'},\n",

Enemy AI is completely uninspired, with the few bosses I could get muster getting being so immensely disappointing that it sucked my will to continue trying completely out of my body.  Spoilers but the second set of bosses is a shockingly shallow imitation of the Mantis Lord fight from Hollow Knight that seems to completely miss what makes that fight so fun and iconic.  Add on top of that a UI that is needlessly cluttered, an equipment system with esoteric and hard to follow skill trees, and half-baked mechanics that hamper the balance of the different ways of playing and it was near impossible to have a playthrough that actually felt strong or unique.\\n\\nSomewhere in the future the folks who made this game have something better, I am certain of that--However with the absolute wealth of Rouge-lites and 2D action games available for people to play it's hard to find any reasons to recommend Skul.

       "  'Review Content': 'First rating at 1h30 of playing : \\n\\nShort opinion : not bad but generic visuals & music, bland gameplay, tedious progression. \\n\\nDetailed opinion : \\n- graphics are nice, animations and design are somewhat generic however. It feels like a game I could\\'ve seen already. The exact same for music : not bad but very generic. \\n- gameplay isn\\'t a fluid as it could be. Your character is slowed down after dashing / when attacking, enemies\\' attack cues and hitboxes aren\\'t clear, cooldowns take forever. Many weapons besides the starting one are even slower.\\n- exploration feels bland. It\\'s a succession of (non randomly generated) rooms, and in 1h30 of gameplay I\\'ve already seen some rooms almost 10 times. Always with the exact sames enemies at the exact same spot.\\n- progression feels teeeeedious. In 1h30, I started about 10 runs; I could only get the 1st boss killed 1 time, and got 2 skill points to spend, just enough to upgrade my damage input by a whooping 12% (instead of hitting 8 I hit 9...) and nothing else. So basically no progression in 1h30. Looting also seems broken, if you don\\'t get a room with a pile of gold, enemies drop so little that you won\\'t be able to buy anything worth during your run. \\n- there\\'s no definite mood to the story, or even the game so far. There\\'s a bit of humor here and there, but other than that, nothing feels glorious, mysterious, heroic, sad, tragic, poetic ... meh. \\n\\nSo not a bad game, but honestly something I could\\'ve played in early 2010\\'s on a browser. By then it would have been a very fine game, but since then we\\'ve gotten Dead Cells, Rogue Legacy 1 & 2 ... Skul feels like an attempt to copy this kind of rogue-like quality, but it\\'s nowhere as captivating.\\n\\n\\nAdditionnal comments at 7h30 of playing : \\n- the gameplay isn\\'t as frustrating as it was, but it\\'s still not satisfying either; I still get lots of hit I can\\'t see coming\\n- same goes for progression : I did get a bit of progress (reached area 2, with some VERY frustrating enemies) but I don\\'t really feel powerful either, and area 1 is still a chore to get through\\n- still no mood, no story, etc. I only got a <10 frames backstory cinematic at the reach of area 2, that\\'s 1 minute or story per 5 hours of gameplay ...\\n- also a \"fun\" thing I noticed : boss of area 1 is a cheap version of The Giant from dead cells, and boss from area 2 is a cheap version of Mantis Lords from Hollow Knight... So that\\'s basically was this game is about : not really bad but done better before by other games.

I was expecting a lot more from this game but the gameplay is slow and when it's not it's hard because it's hard to read and you have to memorise them and I just don't have the time for memorising a game that is boring. Also changing your skull every time you play makes it hard to learn your attacks and skills and many attacks of many skulls just take way too long to execute, making you get hit because your enemy was faster than you. For someone who didn't play that many roguelikes, maybe this game wouldn't feel that bad to play but it's really really boring because both enemies and skulls are just slow as hell. Also if you find a good skull at the beginning of the game you are gonna have an easy time progressing and if you don't then it's gonna be a lot harder so it also feels really unballanced. Another bad thing is instead of giving you normal enemies the game gives you maybe 10 enemies in the same spot but they can't hit you if you stun lock them so most enemies feel absolutely pointless to fight against. It's like developers knew that the enemies couldn't do anything so they throw more enemies at you but it doesn't change anything. The game gets a lot easier after upgrades but upgrading your character takes way too long and most of the time you just get a really small stat upgrade so you don't even notice the difference after one upgrade. Everything about this game is boring unless you get a good skull and you are in the late game areas, only then the game gets fast and exciting but it feels like a chore to get there.

       "  'Review Content': 'This game has a lot of fun but also so much jank that it covers up a lot of the fun aspects.\\nProblems\\nSkulls\\nThe skulls are an interesting idea with the different skulls allowing lots of playstyles with the swap mechanic encouraging mixing and matching skulls. But there are multiple issues with this system. One is that individual skulls are often poorly designed, and the second is the lack of resources. To elaborate on the first issue, many skulls are objectively worse than others. I’m not talking about rarity but in fundamental design. Some skulls have attacks with long windup animations which makes them functionally unusable due to being unable to use their attacks in large combat encounters. Most power skulls are like this and while some may have ways to solve it such as warriors being given I frames during skills. It still doesn’t solve the main issue that almost every enemy attacks faster than the skull.Other skulls simply lack damage and are objectively worse compared to many other skulls in the same category. The second problem ties into this issue. The game discourages experimentation with the stingy amount of materials it gives the player. It takes 140 bones to upgrade a common skull to a legendary skull. It takes 100 bones from unique to legendary. However, a unique skull only gives 20 bones. This leads to a resource issue where there are almost never enough bones to level two skulls concurrently. Only one skull can usually be leveled to legendary unless you get lucky. This means that swap mechanics are almost never used efficiently as there often isn’t a good skull to swap into. This leads to praying that RNG will give you a good skull and enough resources to level it. Even common skulls aren’t guaranteed to appear in a run.\\nControls\\nThe controls for this game are extremely unpolished. Arial movement is almost non-existent with no way to effectively move in the air. This wouldn’t be a problem if not for the large number of enemies on the ground. Another problem is the Dash. The dash is the primary defensive skill allowing for invincibility frames to dodge attacks. It has a few problems however. It’s extremely difficult to tell when the dash comes off cooldown leading to you mashing the dodge button while you get hit because you couldn’t tell if the dash was off cooldown. Another problem is that the dash animation doesn’t exist. It propels you forward without one for many skulls. This makes it extremely difficult to tell where the dash ends and can make movement feel off. The jumping is also not great with no variable jump height which would be fine but platforms don’t feel adjusted to how high you can jump. They feel as if they are placed arbitrarily which leads to you jumping around to see if you can make the jump when you either can’t or you easily clear the height and go way too far up. Overall, the controls don’t feel optimized.\\nEnemies\\nThis is the main issue with the game. The enemies don’t feel like they fit the style of this game. The game feels like it should be a hack and slash type of game. This is due to the amount of cannon fodder enemies and the large area attacks which most skulls have. However, the game also places lots of enemies which feel out of place in this design. Act 4 demonstrates this the most with the game placing cannon fodder knights with spearmen who can sweep across the entire floor along with priests who fire homing projectiles or fill the screen with them along with assassins who teleport to your location with a quick attack. These enemies would be fine on their own as enemies who require more attention. The issue is the game uses all of them at the same time. This leads to a situation of information overload where it is functionally impossible to dodge all attacks due to the large amount of them and the visual stimuli. Enemies also gain inflated health values throughout the game with act 3 and act 4 gaining massive attack and health values that do not match the damage you can deal. \\nRNG\\nThis is the main issue that ties into every single issue and turns the game extremely sour. You need extremely good RNG. While the studio has tried to fix the issue by adding more choices when choosing items. It doesn’t really solve the issue. They made the odds better but they’re still terrible. If you get bad RNG with items or skulls, there is no way to recover. Enemy health values will rise while your damage will remain low. The main issue is that there is nothing in the players control. Your moveset and items are completely out of your control and you have no agency in choosing it. This leads your runs to be decided more by numbers than skill.\\nConclusion\\nThis game has many fundamental issues that hold it back from being recommended. The skull system, while interesting, does not allow for enough experimentation and few skulls are worth using. The movement system is poorly designed and does not allow the player to move efficiently or dodge easily. There are often too much visual stimuli which makes it hard to dodge attacks. There are too many complex enemies each with unique gimmicks which lead to situations where you have to get hit. Everything in the game is decided by RNG with nothing being left up to the player meaning that skill matters much less than luck. Overall, I don’t recommend this game when there are so many better roguelikes like Dead Cells.\\n\\n\\n'},\n",

Controls suck even if you try out changing them around.  Also has no secret zones.  All you do is hope you get a legendary skull.  Basically this whole review summed up about this game is that the maps are crap, the 2nd boss is just a huge mix up of bosses from other games, and just no fun to really play.  If the devs see this review ( even though that is not gonna happen) a way to improve your game is by making the maps load quicker if you have a old pc, making the game funny, not making the game feel like work instead of fun, and make the bosses unique.  Long review but I just felt like I needed to prevent people from wasting like 10 bucks or 20, I can't remember what it costed.  Also thanks to p0kt an for changing how i thought about the game and really opening my eyes about how crappy the game is.  Get it if you like games that need no skill and are luck based.\"},\n",

Some Skulls in the game are down right bad so your run will be significantly worse or you can get abilities on Skulls that are garbage. There are physical skulls and magic skulls with a few exceptions of some being both. All items that you get in a run have \"Inscriptions\". They are Passives that have multiple levels to them the more items you collect that share the same Inscription the stronger they get. However there are only 2 you ever actively go for, Courage for Physical Skulls & Tactics for Magic Skulls because they boost damage. If you do a run with neither of these skills the enemies will eventually be so bullet spongy you will just want to restart.\\n\\nVisuals are some of the best but its not a saving grace for the game. There is an easy mode but all it does is make you take less damage. There is a dodge mechanic in the game but its not very good, some bosses or enemies attack so fast that you will get hit anyway because there is a mechanic in place to not allow you to dodge so many times in a row. Depending on the skull you can dodge 1-3 times, once you dodge your maximum it will have a cooldown so it feels more like dodge the attacks that hit the hardest & tank the weakest.\\n\\nThis game lets you equip 2 Different Skulls in a run that can be upgraded with different rarities. Common (3 upgrades) Rare (2 upgrades) Unique (1 upgrade) & Legendary (0 upgrades). Upgrade are for the current run only & cost change from 10, 30, 100 bones. Bones can only be gotten from very special unique rooms like a giant chest, special Harpy NPC & breaking down other Skulls you don\\'t want from the Green Rooms or after a boss. The rarity will determine how many bones you get when breaking it down & if you decide to break down a Skull you upgraded but don\\'t want anymore you don\\'t get back the bones you spent to upgrade it you get less, its a net loss. For letting you equip 2 skulls in a run its actually damaging to a run to try to upgrade 2 skulls instead of maxing 1 with good inscriptions.\\n\\nThere are also active items called Quintessences, some are broken they might actually carry you or they are useless & cant even be sold more money.\\n\\nThis game can be \"fun\" but if you don\\'t look into the mechanics of the game & jump strait in you are going to be frustrated by the terrible RNG, bad Skulls, limited build diversity ect. It boils down to soft resetting to get a skull you want, max it ASAP, get lucky with item inscriptions & if by act 3/5 if your damage isn\\'t good enough you are going to be fighting the most bullet spongy enemies it would put Borderlands 2 OP Levels to shame.'},\n",

If you don't get a legendary skull and/or some legendary items by the third biome, you're almost definitely going to lose. There's no way to ensure better drops, so you're going to be dying or restarting a lot.\\n-There are ways to upgrade your lower-level skulls along the run, but it's also pretty RNG-based because the amount of upgrade material you get depends on the quality of the skulls you find and discard. (You'll almost never have the amount of materials needed to upgrade a skull at your first opportunity.)\\n-It takes a lot of grinding to get the permanent powerups. \\n-The grinding becomes stale because there are only a few enemy types, a few stage layouts, and one end boss per biome. Paired with the first con, this means that you're going to be playing the first few stages a lot, and it gets boring pretty quickly.\\n\\nIf they added more main bosses (or even varieties), some more level variation, and made some kind of way to overcome the RNG, it could be a game worth revisiting. As of now, I'd much rather play Isaac or some other roguelike that gives you more control over the quality of the run.\\n\"},\n",

       "  'Review Content': 'This is by no means a bad game, so I don’t feel too great about this review, but this rating seems incorrect to me, and steam gives us no better option than up or down.  On the positive side, I love the variation with skulls, items, and power-ups. I love the art-style, music, and even find the story attractive. In all these ways the game deserves a positive rating… just not an overwhelmingly positive one. \\n\\nThat said, here are my issues:\\nFor a roguelite, a full mission run is on the long side. On a really lucky run, it’s taken me 1hr 20 min to clear the map; and in the last game I found myself wanting to die at the ~70 min mark because it was just taking too long. Hades and Isaac both found run-time sweet spots, this one takes more of a rogue legacy approach, but is considerably more aggressive when it comes to damage. This comes to a second issue that I need to break down into points.\\n\\nThe game is a little on the pretentiously difficult side. \\nThis is a 2D platformer bullet hell, where survival is really predicated on one’s ability to jump dash constantly. It becomes difficult to see all that’s happening on the screen and you have considerably less space for maneuverability than say Hades or Isaac because it’s a 2D side-scroller. \\n\\nThe boss difficulty is relatively equitable to hollow night, with the 4th level boss taking more than a little inspiration from radiance. Most bosses have 2 stages, one has 1 + new abilities, another has 3. Each stage has a miniboss stage. This creates situations where, in order to get the time you need to learn the bosses patterns, you need to invest way too much time getting to that part. I learned by using cheat engine, becoming invincible, playing defensively, learning patterns – but in its natural state, the game doesn’t really allow this without a larger time investment. For the record, I played on easy.\\n\\nThe RNG is a little on the tedious side, in that a broad family of skulls probably can’t be won with. A core dynamic involves a constant swapping, and upgrading, which will be heavily constrained by item loadout. This isn’t a dealbreaker, but some skulls deserve more buffs or removal from the rotation.\\n\\nThe rogue-lite upgrades are tedious. At the beginning there’s a very slow grind to upgrade base stats and some of these feel more like penalties you remove than abilities your unlock. There’s not really any variation here (like we see with Isaac & Hades) in so far as you can’t set up configurations that would lend themselves to a specific playstyle, and this feels like a wasted opportunity. These could extend to settings that favor families of skull (e.g. speed, power, balance, magic, physical).\\n\\nTo this end, the difficulty options are inadequate. There’s one setting that reduces enemy damage by 50%, but this is a really blunt approach to a nuanced problem, when I could be broken into components (e.g. reduce number of boss states, limit miniboss types, provide 0.2 sec invulnerability after damage, gain one additional life, add/limit number of levels per stage).  I think this game has tremendous potential to be more versatile in this respect.\\n\\nBasically, I would like it if the game had more options that let the player approach it on their own terms, with the expectation that portion of the player base lacks hyper-twitch reflexes and/or doesn’t have the time to commit to an extended get-gud period, or even protracted play sessions for that matter. If some of this changes I will happily change my review, because this game really has promise. \\n'},\n",

You'll see every room available in each locale after about 5 runs or so of said locale. The only other RNG is what items you receive / see in the shop. And thats not really a good thing, since most items are hot garbage.\\n\\n2) Boring/ unrewarding endgame.\\n Though the characters and story are very charming, and the mechanics start to feel VERY satisfying after about 10 hours or so, that satisfaction starts falling off during the latter half of the game. The locales look cool and feel epic as you progress, but, your experience and mechanics are not rewarded. End game enemies will shit on you in hordes of 20+, your i-frames and dodges will matter less because of the sheer number of enemies with new attacks you are up against, and it will take you another hour to get back to that spot and figure out what those enemies even do. After hours and hours of returning to that spot, you'll realize its more worth your time to just RNG a build that insta-kills rooms and prevents you from seeing any attacks from the endgame enemies at all.\\n\\n3) No replayability\\n This really just summarizes my first two points, but after you finally conquer the final boss ( who is an absolute bitch and half, I still dont know the hitboxes of 90% of its attacks) you have learned enough about the game to know that the majority of builds will not beat the final boss, let alone even reach that point of the game. There is no point in replaying the game with alternate builds, because you'll just be punished for it. What you might think is a fun and powerful build, will end up flopping on the final boss, making you feel like you just wasted an hour of your time. Its not because your mechanics are bad, or you dont know enough about the game, its because the endgame is just really busted, and you need to have an even more busted build to survive.\\n ---------------------\\nI regret spending more than 20 hours on this game, because thats when my fun ran out. The last 30ish hours was just trying to get to the final boss over, and over, and over again, until my build was busted enough to clear it without me having to lift a finger. It would take 100 more hours for me to get to a point were i could actually clear the game with a non-optimal build by skillfully using the games mechanics.

The only consistent healing your going to get in this game is a 10 health orb that drops at random, and when you can have a maximum of 150 health without items, its pretty pointless, especially since enemies will be hitting your for at least double that in the later stages of the game. The only other consistent way to heal is in the shop, but you have to buy it with gold, and the amount that it heals for is random depending on the food item you buy. Other than that, their are 1 or 2 items that allow you to heal, that aren't very good by the way, but you get items buy chance, so the odds of getting them are slim. Most other rogue-likes have reliable healing in the game, so it doesn't feel like your doomed when your health is low. The game is fun, but until they add more reliable ways to heal other than random chance, it just doesn't seem possible to beat.\"},\n",

This isn't helped by the fact that a normal run can take more than 30 min easily. I have played a bunch of other rouge-likes and never have i had such a bad time with luck factors like this game. You might get a good skull but so what if you don't have items, and so what if you don't get enough bones to level it when you need it. In other rouges you could maybe slide by with absolute garbage but with Skul it feels like that's off the table, you know right away going into a new area weather you stand a chance of leaving that area or not.\\n\\nFor the most part the bosses are a yawn and pretty easy, the thing that kills you 9/10 times is just getting chipped away slowly by mobs who sneak in hits that you cant even see because of blinding hit sparks and effects. A lot of the skulls you get to use also just feel useless or that making them good would require such a specific set of items that its not worth gunning for.\\n\\nHonestly I think Skul still has huge potential and i'm gonna keep an eye on it but runs need to be consistently shorter, some balancing needs to be done mainly to make other skuls worthwhile and something about the effects/hit spark need to be addressed\"},\n",

I do get the feeling there are folks who may like it for precisely the reasons most of us wouldn\\'t, and I\\'m torn on whether to recommend it. Ultimately, spending hours in the first three levels crossing your fingers for lucky gear spawns makes Skul so frustrating that it isn\\'t an experience I\\'d wish on anyone else, regardless of how satisfying it can be when the chaos gods slip you their sticky blessing and give you just the right combination of skull and relics. \\n\\nImagine Dark Souls with no save points; make the wrong moves and you can quickly find yourself having wasted your time and starting again. Enemies are capable of inflicting a rapid death from a hundred tiny cuts, and bosses from the second level onward require a fetish to actually enjoy their masochistic tuning. If your movement or timing is off even a little once it\\'s boss time, you\\'ll most likely fail the run.\\n\\nThere is currency that carries over between runs for hereditary \"upgrades\", but those bonuses are meager and give little in the way of a noticeable power spike. There is no way to grind your way to smoother runs, as you might in other roguelikes. The only hope you have is in finding the right combination of relics and skulls.\\n\\nSkul can equip two skulls, each of which has its own abilities. He can swap back and forth between the two as needed mid-combat; in fact, many skulls are most powerful with rapid swapping. Skulls have potency tiers: Common, Rare, Unique, and Legendary. Practically, though, you\\'ll only find success with Unique and Legendary skulls, as the power gap between the first two tiers and the second two tiers is massive. You can upgrade Common and Rare skulls to give them additional abilities and strengthen existing abilities, but even when upgraded they pale in comparison to the abilities you get from the top tier skulls. \\n\\nThis is Skul\\'s biggest weakness: it is so difficult that unless lady luck smiles on you along the way, you have next to no chance of progressing beyond even the early game. Cruelly, Skul will honey pot you, giving you the false impression that you\\'ve put together a strong collection of skulls and relics, only to stand on your neck once it comes boss time, as you realize just how ineffective certain skulls can be. \\n\\nThere are folks out there who will enjoy this. Bosses have patterns, although they have a lot of them, and you can squeak by after learning their routines, though most of them are bullet sponges that will delete you after only a few missteps without high tier skulls and relics to pump out the damage to down them first. Skul gives you absolutely nothing and will slap you in the face for even suggesting it hold your hand. \\n\\nHowever, if you aren\\'t the sort of person who wants to spend hours failing to make inches of progress and wants to feel as if the time you spend with a game will actually yield some form of return on investment, Skul isn\\'t for you. Take the twenty bucks and offer it to a relatively attractive person to punch you in the genitals until you pass out. It\\'s about the same experience.'},\n",

After losing a promising 25~ minute run it is just not exciting to start over with the same stats but +5 Max HP and +1% Crit Chance. Even the more expensive upgrades don't really feel exciting. I rarely had the feeling of making progress with a losing run, it was always learning enemy patterns, and then get beaten by enemies which patterns I had not yet nailed down. Start a new run only to get beaten by the same enemies after another 25~ minutes. Rinse and Repeat. Healing is very hard to come by, so there's very little room for error. Eventually I switched to Easy Mode (50% less damage taken) and was suddenly showered with rare and unique items, that immediately catapulted my progress 2 worlds ahead. Not sure if easy mode affects luck, but it felt unrewarding that a random chance could have this much impact on my run.\\n\\nConclusion - Is Skul for you?\\nSkul is for you, if the existing trailers/screenshots are appealing to you and you get the feeling that I am just a casual that can't appreciate a good challenge. I assure you, I tried my best. If you enjoy learning enemy patterns, and mastering every challenge a game throws at you, you will enjoy this game. It is undoubtely a beautiful piece of art crafted with much love and for that price a steal.\\nHowever, if you look for a more casual approach to roguelites, where a meta-progression will eventually pick up the slack for you, you might feel too overwhelmed by this title and the runs might stress you out and I cannot recommend this game in good faith to you.\\n\\nIn the end, I don't regret my purchase, as I still got some good time out of it, however I cannot beat this game without it becoming a grindy unpleasurable experience.\"},\n",

What is a bad thing though is it doesn\\'t matter how good you are. If you don\\'t have extremely strong items or an extremely strong skull it simply doesn\\'t matter.

On paper, there's a lot of great stuff.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the actual gameplay feels horrible. Aside from an admittedly great jump, the rhythm of the game is incredibly stiff and stuttered; combat feels slow, and everything looks like it's just standing around for most of the time until it does a two-frame attack, then back to stillness. Attacking feels jerky, and Skul, while absolutely adorable, doesn't feel that great to control. The enemies also feel like an HP sponges, especially the bosses.

It is very similar to \"Maple Story\". It is happy and chill, but it does not suit an action-oriented and fast-paced rogue-lite. The pixel graphics are alright, nothing special, but I\\'ve definitely seen worse. Seeing enemy projectiles still can be quite challenging, and the dodge is still a bit clunky after more playtime. What this game lacks is the feel of accomplishment. I don\\'t feel rewarded when playing this. I don\\'t feel like my playthroughs have a lot of meaning. The levels are all mediocre, with flying platforms everywhere. Other similar games at least have a background so the platforms feel like they are anchored. But here? Floating in plain air.\\n\\nIt definitely is not a bad game. I am sure many people will like Skul. But if you played through similar games? You might get disappointed.'},\n",

       "  'Review Content': '(I will update this review if the game changes as it updates.)\\nAn almost fun roguelike that quickly turned repetitive and grindy. One of the main issues with the game is that the progression system basically comes down to slowly increasing stats by small increments for increasingly ridiculously high amounts of the in-game currency. From the start you\\'ll need to do multiple runs just to reach the 3/10 upgrade for one stat like Hp/Attack and getting far enough in a run is extremely difficult because of the largely luck based difficulty per run. I say \"luck based\" because you really aren\\'t making it past the second boss without a unique or legendary skull and even then it needs to be very specific skulls, most of the rare or lower grade skulls are pretty awful so much so that youll end up dropping them without hesitation. Also the resource gain inside runs is too low, you either have to give up gaining a stat increasing item/ new skull for gold or run the risk of not being able to buy anything from the store/even heal since you need to pay for that too. Upgrading skulls during your runs doesn\\'t carry over between runs even though gaining the resources to upgrade are painfully difficult to get by sacrificing other skulls that you barely ever find to begin with. Overall the game feels kind of like an unpolished Dead Cells, I think overtime if the issues above are addressed this game could be great but right now it is bogged down by an unrewarding and slow progression system as well as no real way to improve your runs aside from small stat changes that you\\'d build up over multiple hours of gameplay just to see some slightly bigger numbers appear on your screen.'},\n",

The amount of variance in builds while still being viable is genuinely impressive. The gameplay is fun and feels good. It's challenging without being completely and hopelessly impossible. This is one of my favorite platforming roguelikes.\\n\\nWith that being said, there is one extremely glaring issue that I absolutely cannot believe they didn't fix in the 1.0 release, and it's the only reason I can't recommend this game. There is no (And I do mean literally zero) way to tell what any of your stats, besides health, are at any given time. There are so many different things affecting your lil dude, and absolutely no way to see any of it. There are items and quintessences and Skuls and shrines and a skill tree and spells and blessings and buffs and boss debuffs and several other things going on, but literally no way to know exactly what your stats are at at any time (Do bosses even give debuffs? Idk man because I literally cannot see any stats at all). Should I trade out this item that gives spell damage for this item that gives attack speed? Idfk man, this is my 800th run and I didn't memorize every single little thing affecting me. It wouldn't matter so much if there weren't so many things affecting you at all times (Dead Cells is a good example of a game where stat tracking really isn't necessary). But for a game with such an intense obsession with telling you numbers and percentages and decimal points for everything, it's very very bizarre that they don't give you any way to see your own stats.\\n\\nWith that being said, they've laid out a quarterly roadmap for the game, and they've listed a stat interface as something they're implementing in Q4. My recommendation? Honestly? Don't get the game until then. When they put the stat interface in, I'll be pumping several hundred more hours into the game and I'll also be getting it for my Switch. But until then, I'll just lay in my bed staring at the ceiling, wondering what exactly the sword shrine does.\"},\n",

I've gotten past the first boss only two or three times now, and each of these times it has solely depended on if the game gave me a Legendary character that could drain the boss' health bar in 2-3 moves. Almost all of my woes with this game can be summarized by looking at how much RNG factors into a run; against the minibosses I can get by alright with whatever skull I have equipped, but that first boss is just a huge wall that can only be passed if I have a crushing offense. In any other case, I'm swatted like a fly and left to redo the run, only getting to keep the Dark Quartz collected (not the bone shards?

It was just throwing you into new areas with a different coat of paint, and the stages in said areas also we're clearly copy and pasted areas with nothing new or challenging about it after you go through them a few times.

       "['I really hate to have to review this one negatively but there are just some issues that make the game too frustrating to recommend. \\n\\nI have a few main concerns, and my first is that too often damage feels frustrating and unavoidable. Not always of course, here and there would be no big deal, but it\\'s fairly frequent. Most of the greatest (IMO, obviously) roguelikes like The Binding of Isaac, Enter the Gungeon, Hades, Dead Cells, etc, make it feel like MOST, if not ALL damage is avoidable. This creates an incredible feeling of triumph when, as your knowledge and skill with the game progresses, you can avoid all the damage of the earlier mobs, bosses, traps, whatever with ease. Saving that often valuable HP for the stuff you have yet to make it to in a run so you can learn the nuances of those mobs, bosses, traps. Unfortunately with Skul, there are times where 10+ mobs spawn, all of your attacks are shattering background objects, debris flying everywhere, the enemies projectiles are going off, and you come out of the fight feeling good, look down and you\\'ve lost 20, 30 health and go \"When the hell did that happen? I didn\\'t even think I got hit\".  It\\'s just SO unsatisfying. The combat feels great, and if this were a typical RPG or something where after a fight you could eat, potion up, what have you, it wouldn\\'t feel as discouraging; However in a roguelike, health is a resource, and when you feel like your resources are getting stolen from you with little input on your part, it sucks. This can make it feel like instead of jumping into a fight, you should hang back and just wait for your cooldowns, pop them on the mobs, and then run away and wait for CDs again. \\n\\nMy second main complaint is one I\\'ve seen several reviews mentioning before purchasing, and can definitely agree with them now. The same bosses and floor layouts over and over and over gets really tiring. Most of the boss fights are pretty fun, if a little damage spongey and less mechanical, but they\\'re mostly fun. But seeing the exact same ones, in the exact same spots, every run brings it down. And basically the same thing with the floor layouts/enemy spawns. A few hours in and you\\'ll have seen the majority of floor layouts of each stage and that also just feels too repetitive, too soon.\\n\\nAnd lastly, the RNG/Skull and item imbalance. So, skulls have different rarities, and obviously the higher the rarity, the better the skull (common, rare, unique, legendary). The problem is that the difference between the capabilities of say a rare skull and a legendary skull is truly insane. A legendary skull and no other items can carry you far further than a rare skull and some top tier passives. BUT, they have an upgrade system for lower tier skulls! That sounds awesome! Except it takes a pretty atrocious amount of time garnering enough fragments to upgrade a skull, even if taking every skull drop door option available. So you\\'re basically always just hoping you find a legendary skull, or at least a few unique skulls that you can upgrade a different unique skull into a legendary with. This is not common. In 8 hours of gameplay I\\'ve upgraded just two skulls to legendary, and acquired 2 Legendary skulls as drops. Now, something that really saddened me was that there is a passive item cap. You can hold only 9 passive items, along with one activated item, and two skulls. One of my absolute favourite things in roguelikes is when you\\'ve collected an arsenal of passives, stacking together in awesome ways that make you feel overpowered! That can make having a crappy weapon, or in this case, pair of skulls, feel much less frustrating, because your other items are helping carry the weight. That just doesn\\'t really happen with Skul. With the 9 item cap, you\\'ll mostly be stacking % damage increases of either magical or physical damage, obviously preferably whichever your skulls deal. But as I said earlier, even if you have awesome passives, and crappy skulls, you just often wont have the tools to get through some of the fights. \\n\\nAnyway, I doubt anyone has really read this far, but I hope you believe me when I say I truly would rather recommend this game, as I feel it is quite close to being known as one of the greats. These issues though I feel are quite glaring, and can heavily hinder your enjoyment of the game. I\\'m still going to be playing it, but just a run or two here or there before the frustration sets in. Hopefully in the future there may be some changes to address some of my issues and you can guarantee I\\'ll be changing my review once I feel it\\'s warranted. If you pick up the game, I hope you love it!',\n",
       " 'Every part of me wanted to enjoy this game, and I forced myself to play well past the point of misery to make sure I\\'d given it a fair shake. After 20 hours, I\\'m done. I love roguelikes, roguelites, platformers, 2D souls, metroidvanias, etc. I\\'ve played thousands and thousands of hours of these genres of games that can feel very unforgiving and deeply unfair, but Skul blasts past them all in that regard, quickly crushing my initial excitement into stony silence and leaving me seriously baffled at some of its design choices.\\n\\nTo start off, the concept is great. Little skeleton hopping around, slashing his way through \"heroes\" and switching his head out in Skul\\'s version of a class system. The sprites and animations are great, and the character design is coherent and satisfying. Then we get to mechanics. Immediately, this is where things started to sour. Many of the skulls are so awkward as to be unusable without serious practice (and good luck getting it, because you\\'ll often go several runs without seeing certain skulls). Some are just flat out awful, and even a good skull might stall out if you get the wrong skill when you pick it up. Furthermore, some skulls might be awful or godlike depending on the items you find (or don\\'t). There isn\\'t much player control over what items or skulls you get. I\\'m used to RNG dictating a lot about a run in nearly every roguelike, but in Skul, it feels extreme, like the game just decides whether or not to give you interesting classes or pure trash.\\n\\nNow enter level and enemy design. I truly can\\'t overstate how much these two made this game a \"no\" for me. At first, things are fairly balanced. Foot soldiers, big guys, archers, a variety of fairly tame trees. Then you get into the second zone, and apparently welcome to hell. Now there will be large, massive spongy enemies that do something hideously annoying, and unless you\\'re rockin\\' around with huge modifiers, enjoy spamming your paltry attacks against the maids that summon three other maids, the alchemists that you just aren\\'t going to stop from summoning golems, etc. Then you\\'ve got the \"adventurers\" who vary between utterly harmless and unstoppable teleporting juggernaut, and seem to be another way for the game to inform you your run was doomed from the start.\\n\\nApart from the absolutely wild difference in enemy strength, with some rooms being so sparse and others being packed to the gills with aforementioned hellmaids, the way the game handles level design and healing is dedicated to your suffering. I have on numerous occasions had a nearly flawless run, deftly dodging around and taking my shots carefully, trying to lean into the \"Skill over stats\" ethos. Then you walk into the next room and there are sixty mages, archers, alchemists, exploding ghosts, spinning traps, and suddenly you\\'re 200 HP down and wondering what else you could be doing with your time, because you definitely won\\'t be healing 200 HP back. Here\\'s your 10 HP blip from killing the archer, ninja and paladin adventurers, sucker. Don\\'t even get me started on the \"event\" rooms. After testing out a couple, and giving serious consideration to the risk vs reward proposition, I skip every single one of them. I have what we\\'ll call fairly serious disagreements with the reasoning behind whoever put these rooms together.\\n\\nSo what\\'s the big deal, right? Sounds like \"git gud\" time, yes? Well, sure, but now we have the question, \"Why should I?\" Most roguelikes have upgrades that carry over between runs, and Skul does too. However, the system in place isn\\'t just bland, it\\'s one of the biggest reasons I can\\'t keep going. For starters, the upgrades feel more like you\\'re just missing parts of your character, and you\\'re handicapped until you grind up thousands of quartz so you can start actually playing with a chance. When I die ingloriously in Rogue Legacy, I get to say \"Alright, well, let\\'s spend some gold.\" When I die in BoI, I can say \"Alright well, at least I got that clear before dying.\" Skul I just look sadly at the witch, and consider whether I ought to just stop. The answer was eventually yes. The magic of small incremental upgrades (gotta get them numbers, right dopamine?) fades rapidly in this game, and in no time I was disconnected from the character and had lost any sense of progression.\\n\\nSo in short, I wanted to love Skul, but I guess the developers had other ideas.',\n",
       " 'I wish I could give this game a NEUTRAL rating.\\n\\nThe base gameplay is actually pretty fun, that\\'s why I\\'ve sunk so many hours into this game. But after so many hours, I can\\'t say all of that time was spent having \"fun\". I can have fun with a difficult game, and I can have fun with RNG in a game, but the problem with this game is that [b][i]some skulls (and certain abilities) are so utterly useless you cannot properly play the game until you get a better skull. [/i][/b]\\n\\nOther balance issues:\\nThere is little to no \"choice\" in the game despite all the skulls and item combinations. After you play for a few hours every run will start to feel more or less the same because there\\'s only a few usable skull/build combinations.\\n[list]\\n[*]Using magic damage skull that can let you afk screen wipe like grim reaper.\\n[*]Using good physical damage skull with spammable abilities like predator.\\n[*]All other skulls fall into pretty mediocre physical puncher, or completely useless.\\n[/list]\\n\\nThe inscription system is also really pointless, and seems like flavorless icing to me. You\\'re almost never maxing out any of the inscriptions. You simply cannot play the game with the goal of working towards certain inscriptions without playing like a god, that is if you even get lucky enough to max them out. The worst offender is the spirit inscription, I only faintly recall a single run where I even saw 5 spirit inscription items. That means if I played all my runs with the goal of doing some spirit king inscription, I would have only accomplished it once.\\n\\nThe item limit is too low to be creative. Inscriptions are either impossible to max out and would severely cripple your run if you try to obtain them, or negligible when maxed out.  This results in almost every build turning out into more or less the same physical/magical build. There is not much active itemization choice beyond \"build lots of magic damage\" or \"build lots of physical damage\". Again, the inability to work towards certain inscriptions means there is little to no point in the system, and the stats might as well be built into the items themselves because 90% of your runs will end up being similar item-wise.\\n\\nThe better approach would be to increase item limit to something like 15, but nerf all items across the board. This means early game you might be slightly weaker, but mid-late game you get more creative builds without having to sacrifice usefulness. Now you can finally go full shield/protection while still maintaining enough damage, or go 5 spirit inscription king. Or actually build hybrid magic/physical damage (also I think there\\'s only about 3 or so hybrid items).',\n",
       " 'Was scissors the last item you unlocked in Binding of Isaac? Do you play Enter the Gungeon blindfolded for fun? Do you think exhaustive wikis and actually being able to see your stats are for chumps? Then Skul is the game for you!\\n\\nThe RNG involved in this game is extreme. You cannot win every run you play, not by a long shot. Every enemy in the fourth chapter is ridiculously tanky, designed to slow down even the most OP builds. A few of the hitboxes are wonky, damaging you before the sprite actually gets to you (especially noticable in the goo in the third boss fight). Even if you understand all the patterns an enemy is capable of, certain room layouts throw scores of hard enemies on top of you at once, making it almost impossible to completely avoid taking damage consistently. You do not want to take damage in this game. Healing consists of spending gold you could\\'ve spent on items on food in the shop, which most of the time will only heal you about 1/3 of the way, and some of the food\\'s secondary effects are actually detrimental, like the pineapple preventing you from staggering enemies. The next best healing method is random purple orbs from enemies. These heal you 10 hp, which, past a certain point in the game, doesn\\'t even make up for being hit a single time by a grunt. There\\'s items that make you heal more or heal very slowly on kills, but the 9 inventory slots would be better used for offensive items to make you less likely to take damage in the first place. That\\'s one of my biggest gripes with this game, is that not only is it absurdly difficult, but you can\\'t keep everything you find. You can replace items, but scrapping extra ones for gold is locked behind the most expensive upgrade in the game, tied with an extra life. If a handful of gold is as valuable as an extra life, then I should be able to buy them. But maybe having infinite item slots would be too easy, especially if the damage bonuses are multiplicative instead of additive. Unfortunately, there is no way to know. The official wiki only repeats the info that\\'s already available in the game, aside from what\\'s outdated, which is a lot. And you can\\'t see what your buffs do, either, you have to look at your items and inscriptions and guess what they are. The devs clearly don\\'t care about making the game fair as they\\'ve instead added \"rookie mode\" which makes you take 50% less damage with no restrictions on unlocks or achievements. I hope future updates fix this game because I really don\\'t hate it, there\\'s a lot to like too.\\n\\nFirstly, the main mechanic of the game, skull swapping, is great. You can get a skull that does magic damage if you\\'ve picked up magic boosting items, pick a different one if you don\\'t like its skills, and grind up some to upgrade the two you\\'ve picked out that you like. Sadly, almost one-third of the skulls are sub-optimal for the majority of the game, as they move very slowly and can only dash once on top of this. The graphics are also very good, with the enemies that do similar things in each chapter obviously being upgraded versions of the previous ones without looking like just palette swaps. The story, while not amazing, is a bit more thought out than just \"standard RPG but humans bad and demons good.\" You can rescue some NPCs permanently, so you can get an item from them at the start of your run, or you can rescue npcs multiple times in different runs, that can give you an item, duplicate one you have, or just give a stat boost. I really with you were guaranteed to meet every NPC at some point in every run, because the werewolf that boosts your stats is amazing. Also, the music is pretty decent, each chapter having its own theme alongside different boss/miniboss themes and the menu/credits theme. The game is charming, but not without its flaws. The fact that they have the audacity to put in achievements for beating each boss without taking any damage is laughable. I wish the head-switching and skill customizing ideas were used in a better game.\\n\\nIf you\\'re a veteran of roguelites you should at least buy it on sale, everyone else stay away.',\n",
       " \"This game looks beautiful and I really would like to recommend this, but I can feel that after 9 hours I'm starting to get enough because of how repetitive the game is and how the game mechanics and games systems ultimately seem to boil down to memorization and building muscle memory and nothing else.\\n\\nInitially, the game seems super fun. The upgrade system for switching the character class and building synergies with the different items seems very deep and makes your imagination run. But I get the feeling that it is never really utilized well. The game alternates between levels where you kill a huge amount of cannon fodder and then arrive at bosses. The bosses have clear patterns and usually, the fights consist of stages where these patterns remain similar but get faster and more damaging as the fight goes on. The issue is that the character builds and game mechanics that work in a fun way in the cannon fodder levels, such as mixing different status ailments, do not work [b]at all[/b] at the bosses. It's like the game discards everything about the mechanics in the boss fights excepts raw damage output and memorizing the patterns. And since you cannot practice the bosses, the game becomes a grind where you either get lucky and get a skull that has insane damage output and that is how you win against the boss or you re-run 30-40 minute runs 20-30 times to slowly build muscle memory against all the pattern and keep dying until you could win the bosses using any character, no matter how weak, because you can avoid most of the damage.\\n\\nIn the end, I concluded that nothing else matters in this game other than trying to get lucky and maximizing just raw damage output. Or memorizing the levels and bosses and grinding the game endlessly so you upgrade the permanent upgrades which I assume makes everything easier. But that kinda takes away all of the fun from the game for me and makes all of the complexity and experimentation I thought would be here at the beginning vanish.\",\n",
       " \"As a huge fan of roguelites, this is a tough not recommended from me. Skul feels like it has enormous potential but falls short due to a lack of polish in more or less all areas. \\n\\nThe combat fundamentally has a pretty good feel to it. Hits feel impactful and so on, but the game has a problem with enemies overlapping. This isn't such a big deal in the first levels, where taking some damage isn't crippling, but later on in the game, it becomes a huge problem. The screens in the final area become extremely chaotic, with full of enemies that can shoot lightning-fast projectiles and melee enemies that can't be interrupted. This is made worse by the fact that the game doesn't give the player any post-hit invincibility frames (like every other similar game ever). The result is that you can lose devastating amounts of hitpoints in less than a second if an enemy hits you and it produces a chain reaction. \\n\\nNow, I don't have any problem with games being difficult, but when I can't see what's going on due to the chaos on the screen and enemies standing inside each other, it ends up feeling frustrating instead of fair difficulty. You can even be shot from outside the screen. Most of the time I was afraid to use my melee abilities because most of them tend to lock you into an animation so that you're a sitting duck. For example, using a charge move can often be a bad idea because you can, and often do, take projectile damage during the charge, and there might be an enemy that can't be interrupted in the chunk of enemies you're charging into.\\n\\nTaking some damage here and there wouldn't be so bad, but this game is exceptionally stingy with healing. Most other roguelikes, such as Dead Cells and Slay the Spire, allow you to fully heal between shops or major areas. Skul, however, does not. Sometimes it only lets you heal for 20% HP in shops. The average seems to be around 30% HP of healing. This means that taking damage is tremendously punishing, and careful play is a must. The limited healing combined with the difficulty of avoiding damage due to the chaos led to many frustrating moments for me. It also encourages boring, slow gameplay. In a game that makes damage avoidance so crucial, having clear telegraphs for enemy attacks and as little overall visual noise as possible is paramount. This game does the exact opposite: it has the most clutter I've probably ever seen in any roguelite, and yet avoiding damage is also more important than in most other similar games. \\n\\nSkul features a pretty neat system where character abilites are tied to upgradable skulls that you find along the way. You can also have two of them at a time and swap between them. There are a lot of different skulls, and there's an impressive amount of variety in the way they play. Each skull even has multiple different possible ability sets, so adding them all together adds up to a pretty impressive number. \\n\\nThe problem, however is that some skulls are simply ludicrously overpowered compared to others. My impression after 50 hours is that magic damage is by far more powerful than melee damage. For example, a fully upgraded Samurai skull can't hold a candle to the Archmage or Archlich. Those skulls are capable of wiping entire screens with a single press of a button, while the Samurai struggles to kill even normal enemies despite having an inventory full of physical damage-boosting items, all the while having to endanger himself in melee combat while the magic damage-based skulls mostly don't. This is just one example of the imbalance between the skulls, and there are many, many more. Generally, magic is too powerful, even without the consideration that the magic-based skulls can damage their enemies without putting themselves in danger. \\n\\nThere's also a good selection of items to build your character with, but my experience was that unless you go for damage almost exclusively, especially if you're a physical damage-based character, the late game will feel almost impossible because your damage will be inadequate. The problem with this is that ultimately you're only looking for damage, and all the interesting utility and defense items will start to look unattractive because you know you will need the damage for the final area and final boss, or they will be incredibly difficult due to how long you need to survive in those fights. \\n\\nI did have quite a bit of fun with the game, but the more I played, the more pressing these problems got. I just think there are many, many better and more polished roguelites than this. If you're a massive fan of roguelites and have already finished most of the popular ones, then give this a try, but probably not before then.\",\n",

       " 'As someone who has played every roguelike/rogue-lite in existence (from most popular to the most indie, to games which have been abandoned during their development), Skul was an obvious purchase. There\\'s a lot of things I want to go over so I\\'ll discuss them as we go, with minimal spoilers as possible, as to why I wouldn\\'t recommend the game with its price tag to players into this genre. \\n\\nStory: The game does in fact have a story, however it\\'s very cliche, and shouldn\\'t be a major factor in your decision to purchase it. The events of the game all happen due to a (spoiler)  [spoiler] misunderstanding, however since the story wasn\\'t an issue, the miscommunication driving the plot didn\\'t bother me as I wasn\\'t expecting much to begin with [/spoiler] .\\n\\nHow it plays: \\nSkul\\'s combat is based on different skulls he equips throughout a run (all random), taking on the abilities and moveset of his fallen comrades - this sounds like a wonderful idea to add variety to the game play loops, however, its the main problem with the game in two categories: balancing and controls. Not all skulls are equal, and playing subpar skulls means terrible dps output, or terrible controls. This leads to frustration during a run. as to not getting \\'fun\\' skulls. This shouldn\\'t be an issue I thought because DPS shouldn\\'t be a problem as a veteran player in these types of games, I just need to never get hit and plainly \"get good.\" However, to add difficulty to runs the rooms just increase the amount of enemies in the room (with little to no variety), meaning taking damage is inevitable unless you manage to get lucky with items and skulls to 1 shot every enemy in one swoop. You don\\'t feel you get better at mastering the game you simply get lucky. Now going over the controls, some skulls are perfect while others give force movement in attacks - this is such a terrible idea because many enemies are on ledges, so you are forced to fall, go back up, or hit hazards. You are forced to wait till you land so you don\\'t accidentally do a diagonal ground pound instead of just swiping in the air. Once you land, then you can start attacking or your dps will suffer and you\\'ll waste so much time fighting hundreds of enemies with belated HP\\'s falling off edges or taking hits. So many skulls have abilities that lock you into animation, and for some reason do worse damage than just spamming attack. Another inevitability to get hit. Overall is was a frustrating experience, and I only finished the game on a few different skulls just to write this review, as the game gets so incredibly easy with a normal skull with a normal moveset with abilities that are better than spamming the attack button. My best way to describe this game is that it\\'s a hack n\\' slash with poor balancing.\\n\\nEnemy and level design: \\nIn short, most of the enemies are just reskins of themselves throughout the entire game, and an extra 2 or 3 enemies in every area. It gets so bland fighting the constantly respawning foot soldiers, and the like. The actual levels are fairly bland with some exceptions, with almost NO variety. It gets especially worse near the end of the game (the first area had a large room pool to choose from) where it looks like they gave up designing new rooms as I fight the same rooms over and over again. \\n\\nBosses:\\nIf you\\'ve played these types of games before, the bosses are extremely easy, and can be done hitless with some exceptions. As soon as you\\'ve seen their entire attack pool then you are able to dodge most of them. The major issue though, is DPS is required, so a good build is needed or you will be fighting a boss for a solid 5-10 minutes taking chip damage and eventually losing. I\\'d just like to comment as well that one of the bosses is sadly a reskinned worse version of a boss in Hollow Knight, almost an exact replica.\\n\\nReplayability:\\nDue to lack of variability which is viable, there is not enough of the game to justify replaying it. Once you\\'ve beaten the game there isn\\'t much else to discover after the next few runs. The combat isn\\'t good enough to justify playing it again either (which is my personal reason I play these games). Items don\\'t change much of the gameplay loops, just increase passive stats. If you manage to get lucky with consumable items it can carry you through to the entire game without needing a good run.\\n\\nTl;dr The games difficulty is artificial, with large amount of enemies and large HP, annoying controls at the mercy of RNG (skulls). If you\\'re into these challenging games then Skul isn\\'t one of them, you don\\'t get better at the game, you just get more upgrades for the game to become easier, as taking damage is guaranteed. It\\'s a poorly balanced hack n slash in essence. I\\'m not saying these games are bad but I was expecting the normal Roguelike difficulty of doing runs and getting better at the actual game. It\\'s forced artificial difficulty to bump up playtime until you can unlock more stats at the start of the game. \\n\\n',\n",

       " \"Good-ish game, but the enemies attacks leave me feeling like I've been cheated. I especially hate how the developer's version of difficulty is often able to boiled down to throw more enemies at you and make it so there's less you can actually do to the enemies around you. For example take the mini boss fights in the middle of each level. Each level you progress they just throw more minibosses at you until you are overwhelmed, or you get lucky enough to have a ridiculous build that can carry you to the final boss. The game becomes a battle of attrition until you die, or beat the final boss. The game leaves something to be desired, it's a novel idea and all, just lacks adequate execution. From a game where I would expect to be defeating heroes I would imagine I would be fighting small parties, but instead I have to fight hordes of worthless soldiers that sometimes get free hits on me. I would also expect to be incredibly tanky, but end up being able to die faster than I can in dead cells. On the other side of things, the art direction and style of the game are impeccable, and are something that keeps me from hating this game. The music often calms me down after a stressful run, and the tracks throughout are honestly good. Despite being mostly foreign (from what I know) the devs are hardworking and seem to be caring for their community, even if they are masochists like me for playing games like this. In conclusion the gameplay doesn't really feel all that skill based, but the game still looks and feels good for the most part (I'm looking at you, concentration mechanics).\",\n",
       " 'As much as I will continue to play this game, I can\\'t in good faith recommend it. \\n\\nHaving played many different roguelikes such as Hades, Risk of Rain, Enter the Gungeon, Dead Cells and so on, I can say that while it is indeed a roguelike, it relies on RNG far more than the other games do. All the games mentioned can be played to completion with very little in the way of good RNG and relying mostly on skills, in fact in most of them good RNG can only take you so far and it gets to the point that you require good skills. \\n\\nSkul is somewhat of the opposite, in which skills get you very little if you get bad RNG. This is EXTREMELY evident in the encounter generation. There are 4 types of gates to each encounter, one gives money, one gives an item, one gives a skull and the final one takes you to the shop. 1 or 2 Randomly generate every stage, and it is completely random. You can have a shop appear on the third encounter, and if you haven\\'t taken a money gate yet, you are completely unable to purchase anything, taking you one step closer to the boss with no progression. There is no guaranteed shop or heal before a boss fight, in fact the encounter before a boss fight is empty, as if there is supposed to be some way to heal but they never implemented it. And after the boss fight there is only an NPC with the ability to upgrade a skull, if you actually managed to get enough bones to upgrade, no shop and only a small heal from the boss drop.\\n\\nHaving only completed the first boss and reached the second without completion, I cant comment on any further bosses at this time, but the first boss is rather standard, telegraphed attacks that give you ample time to dodge, with a slightly harder second phase. The second boss however, becomes MUCH harder in its second stage, if you manage to make it. Attacks come much faster than you are able to dodge, so you have to be able to tank through several hits if you hope to win. So far, due to having to start all boss fights with less than optimal health, I have not beaten them yet. The mini bosses that occur half way between each stage are a nice touch, a chance to choose between a skull, quintessence and item upon completion.\\n\\nSkulls are horribly unbalanced, many strength skulls seem downright harmful to the player with how slow they attack, and since health is shared between your skulls and only items increase health, strength skulls have no real benefits when dodging is your best chance at surviving. For the first stage it doesn\\'t really matter, but the second stage is becomes a hindrance to have slow attacks with the sheer volume of enemies in some stages. Speed types honestly seem like the best, but they sit pretty closely with balanced types. Some skulls, like the shield and lancer, seem downright worthless even compared to the base \"skul\" skull. The abilities on skulls are also a random one of 3 (Maybe 4) with some being obviously better than others. There is a good chance you can have a solid skull and a good set of items, but having the wrong ability ends the run. You can upgrade your skulls at a certain NPC that appears after each mini boss and boss fight, but only if you were lucky enough to get enough bones, something that once again is RNG. Unique (Legendary) skulls are obviously the best, but there is a huge difference between them. \\n\\nMap variation is pretty good, I don\\'t recall getting duplicate encounters but I also don\\'t pay that much attention, but some maps are quite inconvenient without prior knowledge, one map in particular has a roof that is covered in spikes with 3 levels. To jump to the third level you need to double jump to make the height, except double jumping takes you into the spikes whereas a single jump wont reach the platform. Small things like that where you need need to make an effort to either jump late or cancel the jump with a dash immediately makes getting around just that little bit inconvenient. I\\'m all for traps that require you to watch your positioning and your movement during battle, but it genuinely seems unintentional and it just punishes you for trying to move around the level normally.\\n\\nOverall if you are looking for a fun roguelike along the caliber of Hades or Enter the Gungeon, you should look elsewhere as this game probably isn\\'t for you. If you wan\\'t a hard roguelike that punishes you for bad RNG despite your skill level, go ahead.',\n",

To its credit, the world it\\'s set in is very charming and very creatively designed, and on paper Skul has a ton of really good ideas. But the one area that quickly lost my interest is the one that matters the most: Gameplay. The entire thing is a slow-moving, tedious, grindy slog from beginning to end (and this is coming from someone who had patience enough to beat Dead Cells on its hardest difficulty). The \"randomized\" stretches of the levels and the things in them, from enemies to other obstacles to items at the end, get extremely repetitive VERY quickly and basically come down to either \"huh, that was a little TOO easy\" or \"OH GOD, please kill me NOW\"; there is NO middle ground. You\\'re either a Shredder-esque menace who encounters no challenge at all until a boss, or a Slim Jim who might as well be poking all of your foes with a dull graphite pencil (and probably breaking it in the process).\\n\\nHowever, all of that and even the overly grindy process of attaining upgrades that are frankly too small to make ANY significant difference still wasn\\'t quite enough to turn me off to this game.

No matter which of them it is, though, they ALL have absolutely ungodly-huge health pools, and you can not afford to try getting aggressive with them so you will be forced to dance around with these clowns for a long time.

(and the binding of isaac for me and many other players is about unlocking all the items and archievements, not merely to \"win the game\".)\\n\\n\"skul\", on the other hand is overhelmingly unbalanced; ok; until you reach the castle, there are not too many problems, nearly every combination of skulls and items and good strategy could bring you there – so the fun indeed is concentrated in the first part, as of course this becomes repetitive pretty fast -; from the castle on, most of the combinatons will make it incredibly difficult to nearly impossible to progress..\\n\\nAnd then you have the overpowered ones.\\nFor example, i had the grim reaper and a very good alchemist - yes, their attributes can differ -; in this combination i seemed nearly undefeatable, the grim reaper does so much damage, has so many advantages, you just rush through the stages, even the two sisters were some sort of child’s play, i died a little bit later, because i became superstitious.\\n\\nok; then for another example, i put all my energy in a combination of fighter and rockstar, reached the two sisters, but no matter what i did, the fight lasted over seven minutes, they continued to build up their health again.\\n\\nyou can use the quartz zu improve your character, but in such a limited way that you wouldn’t have to do it at all, if you got the grim reaper for example in the beginning and some good items. And that in my opinion sucks. \\n\\ncause everytime you play, you hope more and more for that one special skull and every other one makes you more and more disappointed, because you know, no matter how strong it seems at first, at least the sisters will kill you off easily. \\n\\ni think, a game like that must find a balance between luck and skills; at the moment, it\\'s mostly about being lucky.',\n",
       " 'Pros:\\nSkul system is unique\\nHardmode is pretty interesting\\nSome bosses have unique mechanics that are fun.\\n\\nCons:\\nBuild variety is pretty limited, if you play sword you are only looking for bleed items, hybrid classes really have no identity. \\nItem pool seems heavily tilted toward physical items, so it puts magic dealing chars in a strange spot of hoping for re rolls being in your favor at shops. \\nYou will become very bored of the same layouts and enemies over and over. I have played up to hard mode 4, and i have already come to \"hate\" specific rooms. Which with proper random generation would increase replay-ability. \\nThere are people trapped in cages but there seems to be only 5 of them so even events are lacking in variety. \\nTHERE ARE NO SECRET ROOMS, you will maybe see a unique room with treasure every 10 or so runs but typically there are no secret rooms, as I\\'ve mentioned there is limited variety in layouts so this is probably why there are no secret rooms or alternative paths. \\nCertain bosses make melee characters cry, the mage in act 4 stays airborne for 75% of the fight is very annoying, certain skuls have abilities that are impossible to use on bosses such as the gravedigger and Otello on the Boss in Act 4, all the boulders just roll off the platforms and damaging the boss becomes a game of hoping she lands on platforms long enough for the boulders to do damage. \\n\\nI recommend this game if you are looking for a metroidvania style game with limited rogue aspects, with minor replay-ability.',\n",

Didn\\'t like the bosses.  Hated the platforming.  Jump pads in games never seem to work very well, and this is no exception.\\n\\nWhile I get it\\'s a roguelike, I felt like I had zero choices in anything.

I may come back to this, eventually.\\n\\n[b] Disclaimer [/b]\\n\\nI have been a gamer for over 30 years.  I tend to play mostly PC games.  I also bounce around between games A LOT.  I may purchase a $60 game and play it for 2 hours or spend $10 on a game and spend 50 hours on it.  Even if I played a game a short time, it does not mean it is bad.  It just means another game caught my attention.  I also complain about flaws in games a lot, even about the littlest of things.  Keep that in mind when reading my reviews.  If I do not have a complaint, then the game must be special!\\n',\n",
       " \"Don't get me wrong, this is a fun game and there is a lot of exciting elements to this game. However, the game also needs a lot of polishing and balancing. For the 50+ hours I played the game, I pretty much loved the first 40 hour or so, finding new skulls, items, unlocking upgrades, and all the good roguelite stuff. However, the progress of the game kind of stalls after a certain point since there are really not that many upgrades and diverse build paths to unlock like other roguelite games. The last bit of the progress for repairing the castle just cost too much resources and you are really forced to grind your way through many runs to farm resources, while all other upgrades were unlocked much earlier. There are also a lot of polishing issues such as switching between maps, scenes or elevators are simply not smooth enough, but all these are not enough for me to down vote this game. What I consider as the most detrimental flaw of the game is the drastic increase in difficulty for only the last act of the game. The first 3 acts are honestly a breeze, maybe the act 3 deathrattles can be frustrating, but the overall power level and health and damage of all the enemies are not so much far apart. However, act 4 is tortuous as the enemies' abilities start to hit extremely hard with annoying debuffs, and that is not all. All attack damage, health, and number of enemies increase significantly in Act 4, and you really don't know what is gonna kill you next. I am certainly not complaining about the difficulty, I really love the challenge and I think roguelite games SHOULD be hard as game progresses in stages. However, the problem really is the none linear progression of both difficulty and upgrades.\",\n",
       " \"If you're playing on keyboard take the time to go to the controls menu to remap the controls to be WASD to move, mouse click to attack, and shift to dash. The default control scheme is designed to give you carpal tunnel.\\n\\nI want to preface this review by saving I love Roguelites. Hades, Dead cells, Slay The Spire, Risk Of Rain 2, and Gunfire Reborn continue to be some of most played games. So where does Skul fall on this tier list you might ask? Somewhere in the middle to lower-middle end, mainly because of three major problems.\\n\\n1. Your runs are way too RNG-dependent on whether or not you get a good skull or not. In a game like let's say Hades, it's possible to beat your runs with enough skill even if the RNG is bad and you're given tools to control the RNG so you can get what you want. In Skul you're at the mercy of getting a rare or legendary Skull or else you will be slowly powercreep'd out by deadlier enemies spawning in larger numbers. I groaned everytime I got a power skull because of how bad they were most of the time. This takes a lot of fun out of finding that powerful item/power-up in roguelites.\\n\\n2. There is no way to heal during runs outside of buying health at the shop. Since HP is shared between your two swappable skulls this means make one mistake and take a chunk of damage during a fight and your run is pretty much over. There needs to be a health potion or rest chamber system to allow you to restore some HP and breathe a little in-between fights.\\n\\n3. There’s absolutely no saving mechanic during runs. If you need to stop playing for whatever reason, well, you can't or else you lose your run. This is an egregious design for a roguelite, since often this genre is designed around 'pick up and play a bit and come back whenever you like'.\\n\\nOverall I like Skul and what it's trying to accomplish, but I can't in good faith recommend it right now because of these problems. Skul has the potential to get 'up there' and compete with those top tier roguelites but it's not quite there yet.\",\n",

At this point, I\\'ve played for 23 hours. Acts 1 and 2 are basically a time-filler that offer me no real threat. Acts 3 and 4 are obnoxious and unfair.

I really didn't enjoy it in its first iteration, but when I heard that they were completely re balancing things, I wanted to wait until I had a chance to thoroughly put it together.  The unfortunate part about this game is that there isn't a good way to guarantee that you can prolong your adventure other than rngeezus-ing into a skull that has a healing effect.  So two of them that I've encountered in my short playtime.\\nIn every other RL that I've played, there's a verifiable way to make sure that even if you are still trying to grasp what the game has on offer, you can at least try to save yourself and ensure you can learn more as you go.

Not even a little bit.\\n\\nDid you want to die repeatedly attempting to learn what you think is the best way to try to do something?  Good, because before you can even THINK about extending your playtime, you'll have to collect an absurd amount of the in-game resource that persists between deaths, and then spend another un-godly amount of it.  Oh, and don't worry, because enemies get stronger when you die to them.\\nYup\\nAs an insult to an already-piling list of injuries and general injustices against your better judgement, when you die, the enemy that killed you gets stronger.  No hints to suggest better ways of dealing with that threat, no silly quips about nothing, not even some snarky commentary on your previous run.\\nJust pain.  And then more pain.  And hopefully you don't get the same mini-boss you just died on again this next run, or have fun suffering through that.  And if you somehow manage to beat that mini-boss?  There's an actual boss, and then the cycle repeats.  But the mini-boss things are an ever-expanding party of random adventurers that come to end your calcium-rich existence.  So even if you beat them the first roll around, get ready for rounds 2 and beyond, because they come back like a bad rash in summer.\\n\\nAnd frankly, I'd just as soon deal with the rash, because at least I can put calamine lotion on it, chill, and play games.\\nAs I write this review, the developer is broadcasting and even they are struggling with the first boss.

I've played too many superior rogue likes to really want to stick with this.  \\n\\nSo while I don't recommend the game.  I can't say its also something terrible.  Its more...on the verge of being for me but not quite.  5/10. \\n\\nChanges I'd love to see just for my personal tastes: \\n- Boss HP pools reduced.  I didn't mind repeated boss fights in Hades...here it eventually felt like a chore. \\n- Perm progression costs DRASTICALLY reduced.  This is where I hit my wall.  I was struggling to beat Act 2 boss..made it to Act 3 boss once.  All the upgrades 700 tier and 3000 tier were things I'd love to get but the grind to very slowly grab them was just too much of a barrier for me. \\n- Skull upgrades are NOT perm.

Big let down for me.  \\n\\nI have other nitpicks like screen clutter making move telegraphs too difficult in later acts which sucks out the fun for me.  Act 1 is busy but seldom overwhelming.

Should the developer add fixes/balances, that recommendation could definitely change. \\nA few current glaring cons: \\n- A VERY large reliance on RNG, hoping to find exceptional skulls to clear later levels and bosses. In the event you\\'re unlucky, you face an unbalanced upgrade mechanic for common skulls: the amount of materials required vs. those you can actually expect to acquire is incredibly tilted. While you might eke out an upgrade or two, the enemies will outrank you quickly without significant luck.\\n- A dodge/dash mechanic that is iffy at best. This is huge.\\n- Battles that are increasingly more jarring as you progress; often requiring speed to rush in and prevent an enemy\\'s large-scale attack while simultaneously dumping a herd of mobs on you to punish rushing. \\n- A unbalanced health mechanic. To expound: many \"power\" skulls require an element of tanking that isn\\'t made up for in their skillset, while the \"speed\" skulls\\' dash buffs still can\\'t effectively evade many attacks. Heals are few and far between, mostly made up of questionably potent single use purchases in shop rooms, with occasional enemy drops restoring a fraction of your already small health bar. There\\'s a reason the streamer always takes the shield skull.\\n- Learning enemy attack patterns is often largely useless, with some enemies possessing skills that leave you almost no choice but to be hit. I\\'m looking at you, head maids and your plate maids.\\n- Unlike in other roguelites, the long term benefits bought with the spoils of a failed run leave you feeling barely any closer to progressing further in the game. \\n- Unlocking a new starter-zone NPC means very little. Expect perks such as a buff that only lasts about as long as it takes to get through the first floor, a feat that should be easy enough on its own.\\n\\nThis is a game that seems to want its combat to play like Hollow Knight at some points and Dead Cells at others. While they might eventually find the happy medium, they haven\\'t yet. I\\'m looking forward to any fixes in the works, and will update this review accordingly in the event that the game changes significantly. \\nAll that said, I\\'m going to keep playing it because I hate losing. \\nCheers',\n",

       " 'Usually, I love these types of games (roguelikes, hack and slash, etc.) and you can see that with my game time on Binding of Isaac, Hades and Enter the Gungeon. So naturally, I was really excited to play Skul because it was so highly rated on steam, but I left disappointed.\\n\\n[h1] The Good [/h1] \\n\\nI really enjoyed the progression system (similar to Hades) where previous runs impact future runs in the form of increased base stats. Also enjoyed the different skulls and how they impacted gameplay in meaningful and enjoyable ways.\\n\\nHowever, there were some issues in terms of the actual gameplay + visual language of enemies that really soured the whole experience for me.\\n\\n[h1] The Bad [/h1] \\n\\nThe game plays a lot like a roguelike version of Maplestory (Side-scrolling/Platforming/Mobbing/Hack n Slash) and it is honestly super satisfying to have a character that can cut through huge mobs like butter; however, Skul punishes you for \"bad\" gameplay in a way that often feels unfair.\\n\\nVisually keeping track of the numerous enemies, especially when they are stacked on top of each other, is often impossible or very hard to do. You will be sometimes hit by a ranged character or a teleporting melee character with no idea what happened because the enemy\\'s model is hidden behind 5 other enemies. This is mostly in reference to the \"assassin\" mob that runs back and forth and stabs you.\\n\\nAdditionally, the visual language of ranged mobs is often confusing or unintuitive. Ranged mobs will often charge their attack (fire wizards, golden orb priests, ice wizards...forgive the names idk the actual names) and fire them after a short delay.\\n\\nIn most games of this type, enemies who charge these attacks will indicate when they are \"charging\" and when their attack is \"live\" or \"dangerous\". Skul does not do this consistently. Rather, enemies in Skul will indicate they are charging by having their projectile \"growing/powering up\" by their model. This \"growing/powering up\" projectile will often look exactly the same as the \"live/dangeous\" version of the projectile. The only way to really know whether or not a projectile of this type is dangerous is to closely know the time it takes for them to finish charging; otherwise, approaching an enemy charging is a gamble whether the enemy will fire it point blank in your face or if the charging projectile is safe to touch.\\n\\nThis is really important to me because often you will be fighting with 10-50 enemies on your screen and you will need to react reflexively based on the visuals/feel. You won\\'t always be able to just jump away until the ranged enemy is finished firing. So when you get hit by these projectiles, it doesn\\'t feel like you were punished for not respecting the enemy\\'s attack, but rather, it feels like you were cheated out of your HP because you didn\\'t see the moment that mob started charging his attack to subconsciously time it.\\n\\nIn the roguelikes I mentioned above, if you see a projectile on your screen, it is consistently dangerous regardless of whether it is waiting to be fired or fired (example: Bookllet mobs in Enter the Gungeon will surround themselves with projectiles before firing them in their signature attack, but they will still damage the character if you touch them while they are charging).\\n\\nThis criticism may garner a \"git gud\" comment, but I\\'ve seen Skul differentiate between ranged projectiles/attacks and charge time well on other enemies (archers displaying a laser while charging up and firing the arrow projectile after a delay or green trees highlighting the floor pink where their green spikes will appear). In my opinion, the visual language of these attacks are more intuitive and differentiate between charge vs. attack much clearer (contrasting colors between actions) than what I\\'ve mentioned above. \\n\\n[h1] The Conclusion [/h1] \\n\\nOther than the visual language, the game is aesthetically-pleasing and very fun! Just these moments of feeling \"cheated\" really soured my experience and made me put down the game on numerous occasions. \\n\\nPerhaps, my issue is that I\\'m approaching the game with the mindset of never getting hit and that is where my discontent is coming from. If anyone could recommend a mod that would solve this issue of visual clarity I would love to know about it!\\n\\nIn my opinion, Skul is a very good and fun game with very definite pain points that hurt the overall experience.',\n",
       " \"Based on what I initially saw of the game, It looked great, but I don't think there's much besides a neat concept here.\\n\\nOne thing I have to praise the game for is the whole skull swapping thing. Its probably the best power-up mechanic I've seen in a roguelike. You essentially become a whole new character, with its own skills, mechanics and everything. And there's some cool opportunities for builds there for sure.\\n\\nAfter over 24 hours of playing this, though, I realized that I'm having fun 1/3 of the time. Unless you get lucky and get one of the rarer skulls early on, the first stage is just not fun to go through. Its not difficult or anything, it's just tedious; capped by a boss that's essentially just a wall of health. Now, I get what they were going for with the slow start of each run - it's so you can appreciate getting more powerful and feel like a god by the end of it, and that's not necessarily a bad thing.

The core mechanics and gameplay of these games are fun even early on, with the powers you eventually get only enhancing the mayhem you can cause.\\n\\nMaybe it's down to taste, but, outside of the admittedly cool main gimmick, I don't feel see a reason to play this when you have games that do the same things a lot better.\",\n",

       " \"This was fun for the first 5 or so hours. But you get to a point where you're dying at basically the same part give or take 15 seconds, but the resources required to level up any further take 5-10 runs. It's roguelike, but very slow and not rewarding often enough to maintain my interest. I'd recommend something like Rogue Legacy or Risk of Rain 2 if you're more of a few hours a week gaming person.\",\n",
       " \"While it's a decent game for your money, its combat feels super clunky; especially if you've played Dead Cells. Enemies past the first couple of levels tend to not take any hit-stun, yet many of the abilities of the various skulls self-stun you, while also not allowing you to cancel them with the dodge roll. Combining this with enemies attacking very frequently, it become tedious to avoid taking damage while dealing any serious damage yourself. This can be mitigated by some of the better Skulls or some really good item drops, but it requires a lot of rng. Ultimately, the combat just feels bogged down by the slow animations.\\n\\nMaybe in a future update, some of these problems will be addressed, but considering the already did an update focused on overhauling the skull system in the game, I'm not hopeful.\",\n",
       " \"This was my introduction to Roughlike/Roughlite games and I was not the biggest fan of this game.\\n\\nSome major grips I have against Skul: The Hero Slayer:\\n1) The hoards of enemies and the unnecessary/unavoidable damage you take throughout your runs is very annoying.\\n2) Sometimes, so many things are going on and it's very hard to keep track of everything that's trying to kill you. For example, during the battle with Chimera the screen gets cluttered so quickly with all the DVD acid balls bouncing around, the acid raining from the sky, and the enemies falling from the sky. It doesn't help that all these attacks are purple on a purple background. Also, if you try to use a full map attack quintessence with an animation, that adds even more clutter for the fight.\\n3 I really don't like how each mini boss is just adding on more 'adventurers' or making them stronger for the final time you fight them. I feel like adding on more adventurers as the game progresses is really lazy and makes those battles unrewarding. I would rather have unique mini bosses (even if that means making progression even harder because you've never encounter these enemies before).\\n4) The game gets repetitive fairly quickly. This might just be a product of the genre, but most of the time I felt like the only way to make progress was to grind out the skill tree or be insanely lucky and be possessed by mechanical gods.\\n\\nAfter a certain point, I was not enjoying myself and only kept playing because I wanted to finish the game (out of spite).\\n\\nWith all that being said, Skul: The Hero Slayer isn't a terrible game. If you enjoy hack and slash roughlike games, then you'll probably enjoy this one too.\\n\\nPersonally, I did not enjoy the game and I would not recommend it to others.\",\n",

       " \"I don't hate this game, but I don't adore it. It has issues, its just way to rng based. The music at first I thought was actually kinda good, but it gets way to repetitive after having to replay the first world over and over each play-through. I love roguelike games but the game decides if you have a good run and not as much as you. You don't really improve in this game, enemies get free hits on you because many of them stack ontop of one another, or have aoe moves that you either have to just wait till they're done attacking or you touch them because your attacking enemies. The perma upgrades are almost meaningless and require so much grinding to get anywhere with it. The combat is where this game shines, but thats about it. Rng decides if you get good skulls cause believe me, there's plenty of bad ones and meaningless ones. Some higher rarity skulls don't even stand up to some of the more common ones just because rng gave you a bad moveset along with it. Bosses along with mini bosses suck and I have no idea how some people actually like them. The mini bosses feel like a gimmick, and some of them teleport or float. Some of the skulls you find don't even have moves that can hit floating enemies so they absolutely suck for boss fights, but rng decides what skulls you'll find in a run soooo... Dialog feels foreign or at least meaningless to me. I wanted to like this game because the skulls just seem super cool, and some really do. You can have god runs but more often then not you die before you get to the first main boss, and he even has ways to get free hits on you. I just wish there was more enemy variety and less gimmicky boss fights. Magic builds are broken in the game when compared to having to spam attack for melee attacks. I'm sad and disappointed in this game cause I really wanted to find enjoyment in it, and I was for my first few runs, but I'm coming to terms with how rng guided your runs are and finding its more of a waste of time hoping to get good drops then play with bad ones. Maybe you'll like the game for what it has to offer, but the bad outweighs the enjoyment I was having. It's not a horrible game, and it brings some fun concepts, but it's not for me sadly.\",\n",
       " 'Let me preface this with \"I wish steam had a middle of the way button.\" as this game is genuinely a good, addicting game. Even more so if you\\'re a roguelite lover like me.\\n\\nThis game is great, don\\'t get me wrong. I love it, its a great premise with really enjoyable gameplay mechanics and combat. However, the difficulty spike at the second boss is just... ridiculous. In 25 hours I\\'ve made it past the 2nd boss maybe 5 times only to have my ass immediately absolutely handed to me in the next part of the game. Doesn\\'t matter if I\\'ve got a legendary skull with top tier equipment, there are just so many enemies with attacks that are hard to even see let alone dodge, enemies that explode on you, enemies that swarm you and are difficult to hit, a massive excess of annoying traps. Doesn\\'t help that it seems hit boxes are a little odd in this game. Sometimes things that look like they haven\\'t hit you whatsoever hit you, sometimes things that look like they absolutely should have hit you haven\\'t. The dodge also sometimes just kind of feels.. off.. like, you have two dodges on most balance/speed skulls however sometimes it just.. doesn\\'t let you do the second one so you get hit by an attack you could\\'ve dodged. All in all, I\\'ll definitely keep playing this game, but I can\\'t honestly fully recommend it just because its nearly impossible to beat and has a healthy amount of jank. Also, the maids. THE F**KING MAIDS. I SWEAR TO GOD I TAKE MORE DAMAGE FROM THOSE MAIDS THAN I DO FROM THE BOSSES, GOOD GOD.\\n\\nEdit: So after another 10 hours of playing, I can finally consistently make it past the second boss... and I have made it past the 3rd exactly one time because I cheesed it. Now, don\\'t get me wrong, I like the challenge and I like the steady feeling of getting better at the game, however the fact that by the time you\\'ve passed boss 3 it could take you an hour+ to get back after dying, combined with the fact that the game spikes even further in difficulty after boss 2 (it goes from frustrating after boss 1, to stressful after boss 2, to tear out your hair after boss 3) it can be pretty difficult to get any practice against boss 3... and after boss 3, I mean, the miniboss of that stage is as difficult as boss 2.. soo...',\n",
       " 'The gameplay itself is fun. I will say though, progression is tediously slow and more often than not, completely luck reliant.

Devs have refused to add a hold-to-attack option despite widespread cries for it on release, so you will be constantly wincing as you punish your mouse or attack button. Can\\'t jive with a game that asks you to to shorten the lifespan of your own equipment.\\n\\n-My biggest turn-off: It\\'s unbelievably grindy in every aspect; currency farming, permanent upgrades (which you need to make any progress at all),  and ESPECIALLY enemy and boss HP. Once you reliably get past the 2nd boss (which likely won\\'t happen before the 10-15 hour mark or more without rookie mode) then everything becomes a hit sponge and you and the enemies are stuck whittling away at each other.\\n\\n-Add to that because it\\'s worth focusing on: bosses are unbalanced. Huge HP pools, repetitive yet almost undodgable attacks (1-2 per boss after the first biome), and no variance on them run-over-run.\\n\\n-There are variable minibosses which is cool, but the fact that every biome you just get spammed with more of them simultaneously is dry.\\n\\n-Visibility: The devs balanced/designed the game so that so much stuff is on the screen at one time, be it enemies or particle effects, that dodging becomes kind of an afterthought. The z-axis is a mess, and clumped enemies or effects always hide something else that\\'s about to take a chunk out of your HP.\\n\\n-Low replayability incentive: Sure you can grind (like everything else in the game) achievements, cosmetic upgrades etc. but there\\'s no real loop once you beat the story.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n+Art is gorgeous. It\\'s not often I ogle the backgrounds of a sidescroller but I sure did here.\\n\\n+Items and Skulls are varied, but poorly balanced across the board. Lots of build archetypes though, and (eventually at least) stuff you can\\'t use doesn\\'t go to waste.\\n\\n+Nice voice acting work.\\n\\n+Really good animation; not only in the aforementioned \"pretty\" sense, but also in fluidity.\\n\\nI really hope I can come back to change this after some major balance changes and QOL improvements but for now I just can\\'t recommend Skul as a fun or rewarding experience. I love roguelites, but even the rookie mode on this one felt like a slog. A pretty one, but still a drag gamefeel-wise. I do know the devs are still working on the product, so future updates might provide a way for me to come back and see the game anew.',\n",
       " \"I wish there was a neutral/meh rating, because this game [i]does[/i] have some really interesting points. Just not enough to overweight the fairly large weak points.\\n\\nLets start off with the good points :\\n- The game looks and sounds good\\n- For what it's worth, the story is serviceable and the characters are good\\n- The basic movement and dodging is fairly enjoyable\\n- The skull system of basically having 2 classes you can switch between at almost any time is, at its core, a really awesome idea. It brings a lot of flavour to runs and upgrading a skull over a run can feel very good.\\n- The extra difficult game mode seems quite interesting\\n\\nAs for the weak points :\\n- Late in the run, the screen can become incredibly cluttered which is the sort of difficulty that doesn't feel good. Especially with enemy sprites being displayed behind SFXs. Do explosions look cool ? Yeah. Does it feel good to be hit by stuff that wasn't even visible ? No.\\n- Loot RNG is poorly handled : This is a roguelite. RNG is not only expected, it's part of what gives such games their flavour. [i]However[/i] this game has a 9 items cap, which is not necessarily bad in and off itself, especially considering the clutter issues. The problem is that you very often end up getting a choice of items, none of which are upgrades, which you then have to simply abandon on the wayside. This feels absolutely atrocious and [i]will[/i] gimp your runs. You do get a permanent upgrade to get some money when you destroy the trash items. Sadly, it's one of the very last upgrades you can unlock, making the early game more miserable than it has to be.\\n- Skulls are not created equal. Not by a long shot. Lower rarity skulls may need to be upgraded multiple times over the run to start getting good and/or not boring. They may just be plain bad. Or you may simply not have the RNG to get the good active skill on that skull. And the only way to find out is to go all in, pour resources into something that isn't enjoyable for the time being, but may turn out to be great, or not. Which isn't helped by the fact that runs in this game are fairly long. Add to this that, unlike other roguelites, picking archetypes is an ongoing process throughout the run rather than a choice made at the start (like picking a ship in FTL, a survivor in RoR or a weapon in Hades), and you get into situation where picking something bad doesn't just risk a random run. It risks the run you have already spent over half an hour on and on which you managed to have a good thing going. This is not at all conducive to trying things out, which is really unfortunate. Can you look up things online ? Sure, but trying things and finding what fits [i]you[/i] is kind of the point of this sort of system.\\n\\nSo, is this game worth it ? \\nAs things stand I don't think I can recommend it, but I'm sure some people will be able to enjoy the hell out of it.\\nHonestly, just giving the ability to sell items from the start would make the initial push to get the first clear much more enjoyable. And this would be enough to make it a game you can play for a very enjoyable 15-20h. Considering this game's price, this would be a very good deal.\\n\\nHowever, taking this game to the level of truly great roguelites would, I feel, require more profound changes that I don't think would fit in a patch or 2. Still, this game has some really interesting ideas. If progression in a run felt better and gameplay was polished enough to be spot-on, I could see a sequel getting to this sort of level.\",\n",
       " \"I was skeptical of the negative reviews with low amounts of playtime, but now I get it. The game is all padding. There are interesting ideas with head swapping, but the combat is just not good. It's full of identical levels that spawn 3 waves of the same enemy in masses. You fight them by getting them in one big stack and stunlocking them to death. If any are too far out of line, they'll hit you, not that you'll see it coming because all the sprites are overlapped in a big stack. Only time I enjoyed combat at all was in boss fights, everything else was tedium\",\n",
       " \"I love the concept of Skul, but there's simultaneously not enough variety and too much randomness. Each area only has a handful of rooms that seem to always use the same enemy placements, so you start getting a sense of deja vu after only a few runs. Bosses have absolutely massive amounts of health that can take ages to get through if you're unlucky and don't get the right drops, and the minibosses actively prolong fights that aren't that interesting by using healing skills at every opportunity. One miniboss in particular has attacks that are almost trivially easy to dodge, but she follows each one of them up with several seconds of healing. It's awful. \\n\\nAs for there being too much randomness, skull rooms and treasure rooms only drop one totally random item, which may or may not be something that's at all helpful to you. There are shops twice on each level that expand this to three items and one skull, but even with that it's hard to plan a build. Sometimes you get a ton of physical attack items and then the only good skull that ever shows up is magic. Sometimes you get items that don't stack. There's no sense of being able to plan a build here like there was in Hades or Dead Cells. \\n\\nI really wanted to love this game, but I'm already tired of repeating content after all of 3 hours. It's a great idea that needed more time.\",\n",
       " \"While it is a gorgeous game with an amazing premise, it feels like the developers have never built a roguelite or played one either. The game is fun your first run but the flaws start showing up around the time you encounter the first real boss of the game, the Ent King. First of all hes a rough fight that can pretty much 4 shot you at your base health but with good reads you can deal with it. And then it goes into a phase 2 where it becomes much more problematic. By your 4th run some really glaring flaws start showing up. Your progress gained is both expensive and miniscule. There are NPC's such as the Dryder that you come across that take a resource that is neither permanant nor guaranteed to have enough of by the time you get to her across maybe 30 runs I was only able to use her purchase twice and to my dismay at how costly it is (forfieting every upgrade except the 1 you choose to keep along the way) it is not in fact a permanant upgrade to the class. And a lot of these things start showing up where you grind through and get no returns. \\n\\nIn my 4+ hours of play i was only able to clear through to the second major boss and that was only due in fact to getting lucky and pulling the absolutely busted Arch Lich class which carried my run all the way through and then the second major boss just did absolutely terrifying damage as well as having moves that seem to be unavoidable. This of course could be wrong but after 2 and a half more hours of gaining no progress and never getting to the second area again I was never able to test and see. \\n\\nI know that's the spirit of rougelites to be random and different each run but unfortunately the random factors in this game are run killers to a fault, 70% of the classes are extremely bad and the remaining 30% are cool ideas but dont function due to the lack of a progression system. I feel like the makings of a good game are here, and the ambition is definitely there, the sprites are gorgeous and you dont get many games where you can play as a skeleton (a personal love of mine) but unfortunately its a wait and buy. But considering this game has gone through a long beta before getting to this point with none of these issues being fixed I don't see it getting any better.\\n\\nTL:DR Gorgeous game with great ambition ruined by lack of proper progession system or knowledge of the Rogue-lite genre.\",\n",
       " 'I picked this game up thinking it would be somewhat similar to Dead Cells, one of my favorite games. I wasn\\'t completely off base with that assumption but this game seriously lacks the polish and balance a game like Dead Cells has.\\n\\nLet\\'s start with the gameplay, as this is the biggest gripe Ive had with the game so far. I\\'ve managed to get past the second boss once, and that was due to getting two legendary skulls in one run and just demolishing everything. Skulls, the game seems to double down on this mechanic and it almost ruins it. In Dead Cells the player has significant freedom in choosing their items, abilities, and how they want to level them up. This allows players to adapt and overcome situations no matter what items they\\'re given, but there are very very few items that guarantee you a win, if any. That\\'s not the case with Skul, certain Skulls are just terrible, Carleon recruit? he literally has a one slash combo in a game that throws hordes of enemies at you. Ent? have fun doing ground pounds when you inevitability get flung off a ledge.\\n\\nIt seems little time was taken to consider how each skul should interact with the world and each other and instead they just tried to make them look as cool as possible. This eventually comes back to bite you in the ass when half the screen is covered by particle effects. The gameplay  is so unrefined on a basic level it makes playing very difficult. There are sections where it is inevitable that you will take damage. There have been times I was sitting wailing on a plant wall just to be hit by magic from slightly offscreen. Or times when I could stunlock certain enemies and other times I couldn\\'t for some unknown reason. It\\'s also extremely difficult to tell what is or isn\\'t hurting you. Taking damage is barely registered outside of your healthbar going down, which just adds another layer of \"What the hell is going on\"\\n\\nLet\\'s talk about the level design, there isn\\'t any. This is some of the laziest level design ive ever seen, and it reinforces the idea that this game was made simply to show off the skulls. Almost every single room is flat with minimal verticality, most enemies will be fought a flat plane. I don\\'t want to keep returning to dead cells but it is the closest comparison. In dead cells environments are dense, with every surface offering the player a means of maneuverability, You can run up a wall and jump over a charging enemy just so slam down on them, and knock them into the wall with your spartan boots or whatever weapon you have. \\n\\nThat\\'s what makes games like Dead Cells so fun and games like this not so much. In Dead Cells the player always has the tools to succeed and do cool stuff, regardless of their items. Skul however is SO reliant on what items you get in order to succeed that 80% of your runs are dead before the second boss. \\n\\nIn short: Skull balance is bad, enemy variation is bad, level variation is bad, enemy telegraphing is bad (Sometimes being too obvious or not obvious enough), RNG is bad.',\n",

I wanted to pillage and destroy the land to avenge my fallen king and home.\\n\\nI didn't get that.\\n\\nThe combat is fun, and aside from the above gripes I like the look of the game, but every time I try to play it I just start thinking about the game I thought this was, how much more fun that would have been, and I stop.\\n\\nIf you don't have hangups like mine and just want a rogue lite with decently fun combat, you'll probably like it.\\n\\nIf you are weird like me, go read skeleton soldier couldn't protect the dungeon, might scratch the itch.\",\n",
       " \"This game is both good and bad. It does so much right yet gets so much wrong. For each good thing the game does theres always one part of it that fails at. \\nGreat gameplay loop. Slowly learning enemies and their attacks felt great when you finally get the hang of it but some enemies are just flat out inconsistent, Take for example the Area 2 archers. Sometimes they gain a shield and jump back firing 2 arrows but when they do this is completely random so if you use an ability that has an animation and they do that well there goes a quarter of your health. \\nFinally beating the boss that killed you 10 times in a row for the first time really does feel like an accomplishment but your reward is laughable. Most of the time the item for completing an area is just a common that will get scrapped anyway. \\nThey skulls each feel unique and play in a very different way which is good and bad. When picking up a skull for a first time and learning all the moves and attack pattern really is fun it starts to wear though since you only get 5 or 6 starting skulls each of which are all physical attack which really can make half the items you pick up totally useless which brings me to the next point. \\nThe inconsistency of builds. No matter what you do your always at the mercy of the rng. Which is common for a rougelite but my god is it rough in this game. Just beat stage 3 final boss with a magic based skull? Heres a common physical attack item that gives you a bonus if you get hit.\\n The items in the game are divided into either physical or magical and so are the skulls with the majority being physical. This can lead to a lot of runs getting wasted to getting one that doesn't benefit your skull.\\nThe artwork in the game is charming and well done, consistently good throughout. \\nThe inputs feel good and responsive. \\nGetting hit though is were the game really fails, hitboxes are sometimes don't feel good from enemy attacks. There is no on hit immunity which towards the late game can be run ending even from full health since the devs gave the late game bosses beams which do damage on every frame. Got hit by a beam because the skull your using is larger than the platform your supposed to stand on? Boom whole health bar try again next time. \\nAll and all its an alright rougelite thats good to be picked up for a few hours but any extended play will really lead to frustration as rng and questionable design choices kill your run for you. With a few tweaks it really could be a great game but in the meantime Id have to recommend something like Hades over this and its not even close. \\n\",\n",

While this is an indie game, I still have to give them some crap for the bad game/dev decisions. \\n\\n             The Balance Update was a double edged sword, such as some skulls needed buffs were given buffs, and a lot of skulls were remastered in a way that actually somewhat made them worse. (Examples being Reaper, Champion, and Yaksha. Yaksha is actually in a better place, but is now heavily reliant on Skills, Champion can do damage, but his heavy reliance on \"Energy\" makes him lackluster as a Boss Buster. Reaper is a special case, he used to be incredibly good in terms of AoE and DoT effects, but his \"remake\" has been detriment to him. His damage output is a bit better, but most of his abilities are worse, and a good chunk of them require him to be still for a couple seconds when using them, leaving him incredibly susceptible to damage.)\\n               \\n                Another apparent issue are Enemies, most seem recycled (pretty much the EXACT same enemies except re-skinned, with small changes in movesets or effects). Legit the ONLY unique enemy are the Maid enemies in the Tier 2 area, and the Mages from Tier 4. \\n\\n                And don\\'t get me started on the RNG, if you find a skull you like playing that is in the Unique or Legendary tier, good luck getting it again. Cause there\\'s a good chance you won\\'t see it for another couple runs. Now the RNG wouldn\\'t be so crippling if there weren\\'t so many Skulls and items that were so crippling (Even after a good chunk of the \"Balance\" the recent update bought, it hasn\\'t really changed anything, Speed Skulls still run the show, and Balance/Power can\\'t catch up, and it\\'s solely because the ability to dodge damage and be fast is a huge thing for a Rogue Like).\\n\\n               Continuing upon RNG, the rate at which you get healed, the items you receive, it all varies based on RNG. There are some items you\\'ll get that would\\'ve been great early on, but are completely useless in the late game. An example is the Forbidden blade.

After each level, you get items.  The strength of these items varies, some are good and some are bad.  Some characters have transformed, but essentially, they have the same strength.  If there are no good characters, it’s almost impossible to clear the second level, even in beginner mode. So far, the game development team has not designed weapons to be used after disassembly. Some special skulls require close combat, but there aren’t many damage reduction items in the game design.”\\n   \\n By the end of 2023, the game has undergone two years of updates and is basically complete. However, the game still has some shortcomings, which prevent players from reaching the ending.\\n  This game is a  Roguelike game, but the game developers may have forgotten the genre of the game.  The overly long game levels have increased the difficulty of the game, eliminating the majority of players who support this game.\\n  Why doesn’t the game increase the bone meal at the beginning when the difficulty is so high in the later stages?  The special items in the game’s Black Mirror mode are discarded by players because they can hardly deal any damage.  I hope the game company will reconsider the design of the game items.\\n[spoiler]The real ending of this game, even if you play with cheats, it takes more than 90 minutes to complete once.  \\n U =  Roguelike game! [/spoiler]\\n  Compared to 2022, the game has made progress, but there are still many shortcomings. These shortcomings have led most players to lose hope of reaching the ending, even in easy mode.\\n  I should have given this game a good review in 2023, but I bought it in 2022. The disappointment this game brought me outweighed the joy. I maintain my opinion from 2022 and give this review.',\n",
       " \"I have played a sizable number of roguelikes by now, some of them to 100% completion (TboI, Spelunky 2, Enter the Gungeon, Hades) and others to a point where I at least completed a dozen full runs or so (Risk of Rain 2, Slay the Spire, BPM, Spelunky, Dead Cells).\\n\\nThis game didn't pull me in at all. Don't get me wrong, it's by no means bad, but it's also not that good. It doesn't have the excitement of beating a boss flawlessly like in Enter the Gungeon, it doesn't have the ridiculousness of TboI or Slay the Spire, it doesn't offer a clean, brutal challenge like Spelunky 2 or Dead Cells, it doesn't have a fascinating story like Hades - it just doesn't excel anywhere. Since it had so many positive reviews, I tried and tried - maybe I was missing something - but after roughly 7 hours, it still didn't click, and it's hard to justify spending more time on this when there are so many so much better games out there.\\n\\nIt's pretty cheap though, so if you have 2-3 hours to kill it's kinda fun, wouldn't recommend it for anything beyond that. Which kinda sucks, because I am sure the devs poured a lot of love into this.\",\n",
       " \"Would not recommend the game in its current stage due to its low variety of non-melee skulls, and a generally flimsy synergy of skulls and items.\\n\\nEdit: after now seeing the game going out of early access, and seeing still that the developers have about 98% melee skulls (slight exaggeration), I cannot in good conscience recommend this game. I just find myself restarting the game looking for an alchemist, and the skull path isn't even guaranteed to give you a good skull instead of treasure.\\n\\nThere are a lot better roguelike games out there. Skip this one.\",\n",
       " 'Very repetitive, limited permanent upgrades and unlockables.',\n",
       " \"I really like this game. What I don't like is how the game constantly blinds you. There are so many effects that are layered on top of your character and enemies so all you see are the effects and not whats going on behind them. So you get killed over and over because you can't see what's going on. FIX IT DEVS.\",\n",
       " 'This game isnt as good as people say it is - its ok, I got it on sale for 7 euro and its kind of not wroth it even at that price?\\n\\nIll prob play it from time to time but it feels way too dependent on what skull you get to get going.\\nThe gambler skull almost one shots the first mini boss - vs anything else with less dps struggles vs the ninja mini boss that keeps jumping around - it doesnt feel good that I cant \"git gud\" but rather have to keep rolling my runs till i get a good starting skull \\n\\n\\n- id recommend getting something else from your wish list first',\n",
       " 'Now that I\\'ve played 10 hours (as of time of writing) I feel I can give somewhat of a review of this game. This review kind of went on longer than I expected so I will leave a TL:DR.\\n\\nTL:DR: Fun game, but I feel there\\'s too many negative things. Has potential to be a good, solid roguelike but isn\\'t quite there yet. Needs some balance changes, but until it get\\'s those balance changes I can\\'t recommend this game just yet.\\n\\nThis game is fun, and I really mean that even though I have a few negative things to say about it. The skull system is a cool concept, being able to pick up skulls that have different playstyles and moves is fun and finding those really special skulls based off of other games and media is a great experience. The permanent upgrade system is nice, simple, and easy to understand. I always find myself having enough gems to upgrade something so it keeps progression going at a nice, satisfying pace. \\n\\nThe bosses are cool and it\\'s not too hard to memorize their patterns after fighting them a few times, though some skull types have an easier time dodging their attacks compared to others. What I\\'m not too big of a fan of is the \"mini bosses\" that you fight inbetween the big bosses. The first one you fight isn\\'t too bad because it\\'s only one mini boss, but the next mini boss you will fight two at the same time, then the third time you fight them is 3 at a time. It sort of gets more and more hectic as time goes on, and they\\'re not synced up some you may be trying to dodge multiple \"ultimate\" attacks at a time. This often leads to me either just tanking the hits so I can get damage done to the enemies or drag out the fight for long periods trying to dodge all of the attacks. I feel that if the mini bosses were more in sync it would be easier to see patterns and fight more effectively. \\n\\nWhile the skull system is cool there are often times where I find a skull that I like early game only for it to be constantly under powered because I seem to never have enough bones to upgrade it. Every time I have the option to go to a room that has a skull drop I always go to it just so I can get more bones so I can upgrade the skull I have but even then I\\'m always lacking bones to upgrade with. I always seem to be just 5-10 bones away from upgrading. Most, if not all, of my good runs have been because a higher tier skull had dropped early game that allowed me to focus less on getting bones and focus more on getting items to buff my character with. There have also been times where a higher tier skull has dropped early game only for me to still go to every skull drop room for bones and I still not have enough bones to upgrade with. Upgrading skulls has usually come down to the point where it\\'s nearly impossible for me to upgrade unless some higher tier skulls drop and I for some reason choose to dismantle the higher tier skull for bones instead of switching skulls for the obviously higher tiered, more powerful one. It can create some pretty frustrating experiences from time to time. \\n\\nAnd with talking about the skulls, I feel like some skull types are just plain better than others. Speed types seem to always lead to good runs for me since they\\'re faster and usually can dish out a lot of damage. I especially like the thief skull since if I get the chance to upgrade it it can really start doing damage and can clear groups of enemies. On the other hand I feel that power type skulls just don\\'t have enough benefits to warrant playing them. I find it sad because I find that the power skulls are more fun for me to play. They\\'re what you expect, their attacks are slow but they hit hard. They\\'re also slow, taking away one of your two dashes but your dash does (negligible) damage. Since they\\'re slow and you only get one short dash it makes it more difficult to dodge attacks meaning you get hit more. While it\\'s possible to dodge every attack I\\'m more talking about sub-optimal play, the average player isn\\'t going to play perfectly. So even though I like playing power types I often gravitate towards speed types because it\\'s not too hard to make them do more damage than power types, they\\'re fast, and I still get to keep my two dashes. So why should I play power types if speed types can do more damage, move faster, keep my two dashes, and ultimately make it easier to dodge attacks? \\n\\nNow I will talk about the maps. I like them design \"look\" wise, though most of the time you will be too focused on fighting enemies to even pay attention to it. Some rooms are difficult and some are easy, so no complaints there, there seems to be a decent balance. Though I will talk about some rooms where it\\'s just throw as many enemies at you as possible and as soon as you kill a pack of enemies another one just spawns in it\\'s place. These are the rooms where I end up losing the most life just because the sheer number of enemies makes it difficult to dodge all of the attacks. And it goes on for a long time, you will sit there mowing down enemies for whole minutes with no end in sight. There are also some rooms where the pace of the game just grinds down to a crawl where you just have to sit there patiently, or grab some water or food, make on omelet, read a book, learn a new skill, find a new hobby, and wait for the enemy to finish doing their thing so you can go attack them and hopefully kill them before they do their attack in which you back off and repeat the cycle(obviously an over-exaggeration, but you get the idea). Some rooms, but not often, have questionable trap placement where the option is to either get hit by an enemy\\'s attack or dodge the attack and get hit by the trap, or the third option to run away and wait for them to do their thing and attack when they are done. Sometimes there is no third option.\\n\\nAll in all, this review was wrote with the point of view of a normal run. There are items you can get that greatly help your character and there are times that you hardly get any items that help your character out. The normal run I am referring to is the run where you get both items that help your character type and those that don\\'t. Obviously there are scenarios where you get great items and skulls, but there\\'s also an equal number of runs where you just get a lot of items that don\\'t help your skulls. I\\'m reviewing the \"middle ground\".\\n\\nUltimately, I have to choose whether I will recommend this game or not and I wish there was an option to give it a more mixed recommendation. But, I\\'m not going to recommend this game. I originally recommended it, but upon further thinking I decided to change my opinion. This game has potential, but I feel that it isn\\'t quite there yet. Needs some balance changes, and until it get\\'s those balance changes, I can\\'t recommend this game just yet. I might update my review if changes happen, but no guarantee.',\n",
       " \"I think this game could've become better if given more time, to me i feel like certain things feels under-developed like the maps, maps in the game, to me, feel like it favors more precise movement which the player doesn't, the player feels more floaty to me, it feels like i can barely land on places, doesn't help that enemy placement can also be bad at times, for example, an enemy being next to a bounce pad where the character seems to magnetize itself to it during a jump.\\n\\nAnother issue to me is that skulls and upgrading them cost bones, now, costing bones to upgrade the skulls isn't a bad thing, its actually really good because it makes lower tier skulls become more viable in mid to late game. My biggest gripe about it though is that, unless you are focusing on going to skull rooms, which aren't that common mind you, you won't get enough bones to upgrade those lower tier skulls, making the rarer skulls more of a necessity than an option for your current build.\\n\\nI also heard that the game gets much better once the meta progression is done and all that, which, imo, is a bit of a letdown to me.\\n\\nAgain, this is my opinion from playing 45 minutes into the game, i did ask for a refund but i do think if the devs fix these issues im willing to buy it again and give it another chance, it has potential to be good.\",\n",

I feel like there's so many similar games that just feel better. \\n\\nThe head thing is cool, but I mostly kept getting the same ones with slightly different caveats. There were times where it felt like there was too much going on for it to be fun. I can handle difficulty, but this game's difficulty just didn't feel good to me.  A lot of enemy visuals can work if the game is clear about what is happening, but with this game I'd have an archer and a tree cast roots under me. Attack patterns like that would alternate, and it just felt clunky trying to dodge it with the controls. It felt like I never got even a little bit of room to breathe at times. It seems like some attacks don't care about walls. \\n\\nHonestly, this game feels like it's early access.  Like it's ALMOST at the point where it'd click.  I feel like there was no weight to any of the skills I used.  I may keep an eye on it and give it another shot in the future, but as it is currently...it just feels off.

       " 'I tried it for a while (37 hrs at this point), but in the end I have noticed I end up too often being annoyed at the game instead of enjoying the challenge. The game is still pretty good in overall concept, I\\'m just not really enjoying it any more.\\n\\nPro\\'s:\\n* Very nice diversity in skulls and abilities. It gives a nice incentive to upgrade your skulls, as they\\'ll increase your abilities too.\\n* Huge diversity in obtainable items.\\n* The Quintessences add a nice twist to the combat. You\\'re not solely reliant on the abilities of you skull.\\n* Nice touch that the mini-bosses actually try to heal themselves during the fights (although you should be able to beat the crap out of them when they do so).\\n* Plays smoothly with a controller.\\n\\nCons:\\n* Some of the level designs don\\'t make any sense. Especially the first act has a couple of horribly designed levels.\\n* There are WAY too many inscriptions. It\\'s nigh impossible to try out something specific. Even in 20+ runs you might be lucky to scrape together something that would barely resemble \"a build\", let alone something that actually fits your current skull(s). Of course randomness is part of the genre, but I feel like Hades (and Monster Train, and Nova Drift) had these balanced out a lot better. A lot of the runs just end up with trying to make the best of all the random thrash that\\'s thrown at you.\\n* Speaking of thrash, boss rewards are crap 9/10 times.\\n* The mini bosses are badly balanced. The sword fighter is annoying as hell, while the other ones are a cakewalk.\\n** The upgraded version you encounter in the 4th area is a nice challenging improvement though.\\n* The later fights with 2-3 of the mini-bosses together are, in my eyes, a classical mix-up of confusing \"annoying\" with \"challenging\". There\\'s usually way too much going on to have any idea what target to focus without getting blasted to pieces. It\\'s too much of a chaotic mess for my taste. You could play it safe and keep your distance, but that just completely kills the pacing of the game. If they have the priestess on the team expect to double the time required to grind out these fights.\\n** Some of the other fights also suffer from \"too much crap on the screen to see what\\'s going on\".\\n* \"Go to title screen\" not only does what it says on the tin... it also restarts your current run. That was quite a surprise when all I wanted to try was to see if my controller did reconnect.\\n* The grind is long an lacking in progression. You have some permanent upgrades with the traits, but I feel like their impact is too low to effectively aid you long-term in actually finishing the game. After upgrading most traits (which are quite limited) you can only keep banging you head against the wall until you might get that \"perfect run\".\\n* Bunch of minor issues regarding timing and balancing in a some of the fights, but this list is already too long.\\n\\nAll in all there\\'s too much lacking in design, balance and progression for my taste. The inscriptions give some nice theoretical combinations, but there\\'s nowhere close too any option available to allow for any consistency in a run (I found Slay the Spire suffered from the same problem). I wouldn\\'t mind being able to pay 200-500 gold to actually delete an item from the current run (I destroyed a lot of item rewards, only for them to show up in the shop again ffs). I think this is overall the biggest downside, there\\'s just too much randomness to allow for any form of control for the player over their progression during a run. For example, Hades limited the amount of Olympians to four per run (with some exceptions), which allowed for at least some consistency in building up your progression. I feel like Skul just ends up too often with trying to deal with the mess you\\'re being dealt for the entirety of a run.\\n\\nAnyhow, I would say you still give this game a fair try, since this entire rant is highly subjective and just one opinion among many. I just wouldn\\'t recommend it above the (many) alternatives.\\n\\nGuess I\\'ll give Dead Cells another try.',\n",

For example, I was trying get one of the legendary skull (think of it as various power ranger suits and you get the idea) to either to use or savage for parts but I keep on getting commons or something that mediocre to use that wasn't worth the trip. \\n\\nThe major problem for this Action rougelike game is that is no real actual multiple path to take where the enemies are harder or location is vastly different for each chapter.

And considering how stingy the game is with healing, you never want to take damage.\\n\\nThe game's core mechanic, which is Skulls and Swapping, is heavily disincentivized for you to use as the game constantly punishes you for wanting to use two skulls at once; swapping has a long cooldown and is often times very high commitment, damage increases are separated into two types for no discernable reason, and upgrading skulls is expensive and only works for one skull at a time.\\n\\nMajor gameplay mechanics are locked behind permanent progression systems in a way reminiscent of Hades, but noticeably more frustrating as many of them are necessary in order to play the game in more engaging ways (such as a reduced swap cooldown or the ability to scrap unwanted items).\\n\\nIf you want a sidescrolling roguelike with fun, challenging combat, play Dead Cells.

A little on the easy side, once you got all the upgrades and mastered the various skulls, but fun and engaging. The new updates have completely broken the game balance, though, and it's now an utter slog. Even fully upgraded, unless you get an astoundingly broken combination of skulls, items, and quintessence, you just can't break through the wall of HP the game throws at you in the last two levels.\\n\\nEnemies take a minute or more even just pounding away at them with constant attacks, and some rooms throw dozens at a time at you, making it impossible to read or predict enemy attacks to dodge them, and all but the most basic grunts can't be hitstunned, forcing you to play in the most passive, cautious, and boring way to avoid simply being destroyed before you can slowly chip down their health bars. Especially offensive are the last few bosses - the final miniboss, a powered-up version of one of the hero trainees you've fought before, can't be interrupted at all, attacks constantly with difficult to dodge attacks that render all but your basic hit too dangerous to use, and has so much health that even room-clearing super attacks do about 5% damage to its health bar.

I beat all dark souls, bloodborne, risk of rain 1 and 2 and so on games, i know i'm not a bad player per say, but this game just makes me feel so incompetent when i'm trying to get to a boss with full health but the rooms keep f**** me with all the mobs and traps and ranged atks and explosions and i'm not seeing where i am and o God my health.....\\nAs of right now, i got to the last boss once, but with low health and so, i died.

The game has only a couple of different environments (3) and it seems the devs up the difficulty to compensate for that. \\nThe various skulls, allthough fun to experiment with, offer little advantage in terms of GP, while some feel downright unsuable. \\nThe only skull worth mentioning is the alchemist, and that's just because you can cheese 90% of the game with it's lock on fire mode.\\nI have sinked 23+ hrs in this game so far, but i lost all incentive to ever start this up again, and in the end it just feels like a massive time waste.\\nThe progress tree is useless atm, i had full HP and max DMG after 10 hrs or so and some areas in the game still feel like they were designed jsut to straight up drain you of HP as much as possible. I assume, again, to compensate for lack of enviroments and enemies.  \\nI'm not much of a rouge  fan, but i understand these type of games get easier as you progress so you can just fly through the starting levels. In this game you can play through the first 10 levels and have your ass handed to you often, then you upgrade everything and you still feel way underpowered to the point it still takes you a long time to go through the same 10 levels again. And it just feels mindnumbing.\\nThe bosses are Hollow Knight-esque in the sense you have to learn their patterns prefectly to save as much HP as possible, but in HK you can just skip everything and go for the boss that killed you again and again, in relatively short time. Here you have to grind and grind and goddamn grind some more until you can even attempt the same boss again let alone begin to learn it's patterns.\\nI will review this again, once it's out of EA, maybe it'll get better. I would love to leave a postive review since i had fun with the game initially, but after 20 hrs of button mashing (not unlike a mobile clicker game) i'm done. It's just not fun.\\n\\nP. S. Whoever designed the waitress/help (the ones with the bell and summon) enemies in the castle should be made to play a level with 10's of these all over again, every day, until something better comes to mind.

Granted there are healing items that drop although it just comes across as not a good way to balance difficulty. MY MAIN GRIPE with this game though is that while I'm not a big fan of rogue-similar games, despite Hades and Dead Cells being 2 of my favorite games, Skul like most other rogue similar games relies on the stars and planets aligning for you to get a good build or good items for you to make any reasonable progress. Don't have at least one legendary item? Then this run is probably a wash and you have no chance in hell making it farther than you did last time.

The difficulty curve is also too steep imo like from the third world/area bosses require a lot of dodging with pin point precision which might not even be possible due the skull (class) you're currently using. This is made worse with the RNG. Skul is a roguelite that is a roguelite where you're strengths and abilities are largely dependent on the skulls you pickup in the game (hence the name). These act as classes and there are a lot of them. Some are seriously powerful and fun like the Grim reaper, Rock star (yes you can be a rock star), lich, berserker etc. but a lot of the others are kinda meh. If you don't get the good ones your run is kinda fucked. You might have to grind a lot improve your base stats/abilities through the meta progression to mitigate the RNG. THe clarity issues can also be pretty annoying and makes the dodging even harder. As others have mentioned in the reviews, mid to late game the screen can get pretty chaotic with tons of enemies, projectiles and attacks. Its hard to git gud, when you're experiencing sensory overload and potentially a seizure even.\\n\\nThe artstyle, sound and the game design itself are actually pretty well done.

Good luck targeting anything.\\n\\nJust not my kind of game. EXTREMELY repetitive and slow with very FEW options. Its all a game of chance and death. You cannot really grind or avoid boss battles, you're forced to progress and DIE. If you're the type who prefers the grind THEN the boss battle, this isn't you're game. the game WANTS YOU TO DIE. the point of the game is progress, gain stones, die, use stones to upgrade and start over (yes including boss battles). You don't acquire these stones quickly or easily I might add dragging out the game beyond whats necessary. Its like turning back the clock and starting over, but keeping EXP. Interesting concept, and interesting story. You cannot really choose skulls, you're presented with random skulls which makes it difficult to progress because the game is very random and not forgiving. You cannot really target specific skulls or skills. Its a constant mixed bag of gambling and even with a maxxed out character, its possible to lose if random chance wasn't on your side that day.  Healing is rare and there are no potions. Start out on rookie mode, and you'll get a buff that looks like a skull with a pacifier (kind of interesting way to insult the player)?\\n\\nIs the game fun? It definitely can be. Acquiring the Grim Reaper skull makes the game a blast and allows actual progression. I was able to reach the very last boss battle and it can be pretty OP if you have the right addons (which are also a game of chance and cannot be targeted). I wish the game devs thought about making the default Skul upgradeable to the Grim Reaper upon acquring 150 bone fragments or something. I bought the game, and I'll see it through to the end, but the completely random and gambling nature of the game is a turn off. Getting constantly jacked by not having the best of luck is extremely frustrating with no benefit. Some people actually like to play the game, learn, target specifics, and play their way rather than gamble their way through the game's casino style methods and hope they make it out in the end.\\n\\nIs the game worth the money?

If you\\'re not playing as cheaply as the game is, that would have been 1hr+ just flushed down the toilet, because good luck building the exact same load-out to try again.\\n\\nI don\\'t think there\\'s an item catalog/explanation in the game, but that would be handy, to try things without beating my head against the wall or losing 40+ minutes of run time. When your build is bad, you\\'re basically locked into it if you have all your items/synergies/dark abilities and you\\'re in act 3 or 4.\\n\\nI liked rookie mode to fill out the initial skill tree, and to learn the \"normal\" encounters. Honestly if you could turn it on in the Dark Mirror, I could see myself actually trying to play the game without restarting maps constantly, which gets un-fun pretty quick.\\n\\nIn conclusion, if you\\'re wanting to play this game to have fun, and see all it has to offer, look elsewhere. Just play it a bit, refund it, then watch it on youtube.\\n\\nIf you\\'re wanting to play this game because you need a sense of achievement in your life and still count abusing the crap out of a game as achieving something, this is the one for you.\\n\\nEdit: After beating DM 10 etc., it turns out the Dark Mirror 0 achievement bugged out on me.

You stand almost no chance unless you grind for the currency in this game quartz or you get super lucky with items on a run.\\n\\nIn a well designed rouge like, skill should matter first, items second. In Skul, skill doesn't matter, if you don't get the right items, enjoy hitting basic enemies for 200 years before they die, while each one can damage you for about 1/5th of your health bar.\\n\\nAnd that's just one issue not to mention the boss mechanics, the repetitiveness, and the difficulty spikes.

       " \"I want to start out saying that despite what I will say in this review I do really love and respect this game and the effort has gone into it.\\n\\nSkull is a rougelite, you start out a run with the default head and the upgrades you have purchased so far as well as your permanent upgrade currency (dark quartz) and depending on how far you have advanced 1 random head and item. \\nThe head system is really unique allowing you to hold 2 heads which are essentially skillsets which you can swap between, the combat consists of gathering heads and items which you use in synergy to kill enemy hordes, minibosses and then the main bosses, the majority of the game revolves around surviving on the way to the bosses while gathering money to buy items, fighting for items, upgrading your skulls and doing anything to ensure you are as powerful as possible  to fight the main bosses.\\n\\nThe concept of the main game is really solid but there's just a few things which drag it down and stop me from enjoying it. Those are:\\n-Very limited hp recovery\\n-Enemies placed in ways which are near impossible to deal with without the right skulls or abilities\\n-Luck being the main thing which determines how well your run goes\\n-Enemies who are unfun to fight\\n-Enemies who make particle effects which clutter too much of the screen\\n\\nNormally I wouldn't complain about these issues but when they're combined it just makes an overall experience which can feel more like a chore than a game,\\nAs an example of all these issues: In the first area there's an enemy who makes a cloud of smoke around themselves which damages you if you enter it but then they're placed on a platform above traps and then unknown to you is protected by another enemy which spawns spikes beneath your feet, this means you jump on the platform to kill the smoke enemy and then see the indicator for the spikes which means you have to then choose between killing the smoke enemy and taking the damage from the spikes or dodging away and hoping the enemy doesn't make the smoke and damage you, you now have to try and not land on the traps before you can then try and kill them again and if you didn't get good skulls before this point your only option is to jump up and try the melee option so if you take damage you're now gonna have a real hard time recovering that hp before a boss.\\n\\nAgain I really love this game but when I have to be really lucky to get a good skull or grind for hours to get some slightly better permanent upgrades to enjoy it it just feels like a slog especially after you've just lost a really good run and know you have to go back to the grind.\",\n",

The game is fun when it decides to run properly, this is not a problem most people will have but it is one I do, so I can say I did not enjoy my experience with this game.

The upgrades are tiny things like +1% to crit chance, slightly more physical damage, or 5 extra hp. None of the upgrades feel interesting or game changing. Also, the game quickly becomes pretty grindy.  You will end up doing 3-4 runs before you can purchase one of the minuscule upgrades mentioned above. You will end up doing dozens of runs before you even feel like you have the chance to beat it once or unlock anything interesting. Overall, I would just suggest you play almost any other rogue-lite.

I get disheartened every time I get to the 2nd stage because every thing seems more geared like an end game area then the next level.\\n 60% of the time I could not tell you what hits me in the banquet hall, with the most frustrating enemy being a maid of all things. said maid seems un-effected by stagger unlike most other enemies and can only endlessly spawn more enemies or cause explosions so fighting them feels more like a punishment than a challenge. The bosses and damage are also a problem, which isn\\'t to say they are/hit too hard, its just you do too little/ the bosses have too much health. even with max passive damage upgrades and an inventory full of damage increasing items, one mini boss took me 10 minutes to kill, simply because I could only whittle away at her health bar and that she had a rage skill that healed her for around 50%.\\n The damage problem, at least in my opinion, seems to come from the fact that items increase stats by percentage rather than a flat value, so when your naturally doing 9-20 damage, not counting crits, a 40% increase really doesn\\'t improve much.\\nThe randomness of items is detrimental to the games experience as well. The ability to switch classes/skills via swamping heads is interesting and fun, but the skills you get with the classes are randomized, making the new class shaky whether it was the previous class you had fun with or if the new skill makes in more detrimental to use. Often times, I found the starting head better to use than any of classes I find (of which I would say around 1/3rd the heads I find). The class heads dropping at random also seems kinda bad gameplay wise because you cant really choose your setup or experience for the run ahead.\\n I \"would\" say that getting to choose your class/head from the start of your would be more interesting, with maybe a way to unlock the skulls for use back at base, but I do understand that this idea is unruly in a number of ways including having to rework pretty much the majority of the game in order to do so as well as removing/reworking one of the main rouge-light mechanics. (I don\\'t know, maybe this idea is just my personal opinion.)\\nOverall I do like this game alot but playing it often times, in its current state atleast, can be frustrating do to balancing issues.

       " 'Like every game I buy, I do want to like it and enjoy playing it. Sad to say that a lot of these indie games just miss the make on so many obvious things. \\n\\nI think Skul has some things going for it. It’s an interesting concept. The item and skull rotation help give freshness to each play. Unfortunately, that’s kind of where the good stuff ends. \\n\\nThe most obvious issue with the game is the lack of an extensive level system. Honestly, there just isn’t enough here for plays to want. A game like this should be stuffed with heaps of abilities and things to unlock. This is what makes a game like Rouge Legacy an A+ game that you can spend a few hundred hours playing.  After 27 hours on Skul, I am just tapped out. I haven’t beat the game yet, but there isn’t really anything new for me to unlock, so I’m just kind of done. \\n\\nThis brings us to the biggest unobvious issue with the game; it lacks any type of tutorial and the game never explains any of the mechanics to the player. Everything I know about Skul I learned for going online and researching, not from playing. This is a huge issue with the game and does ruin a good a bit of the enjoyment. I can’t stress how much this really bothers me. Even at 27 hours in I’m still unsure of some of the game mechanics.  \\n\\nOther things about the game that get annoying is how many hits enemies take as you get to higher levels. Some even have shield generators and those things take about 30 hits to destroy. Then you have regular enemies, not bosses, that can take 40 to 50 hits.  This is just where the game grinds and gets super boring. \\n\\nSo, in the end this game feels very novice and unfinished. It doesn’t feel like the effort from a company that has produced a good game before.  Looking at their game line and I can see they’re not a company with any software to brag about. \\n\\nIf you can get this for free, or under $1, go for it. I wouldn’t spend any more on this one.  The fact that they sell this for $20 is highway robbery. \\n\\n',\n",

Would refund it if I could. Save your money or get Dead Cells. This games not worth it and the entertainment value is shot after a few hours.\",\n",
       " \"Unfortunately, I'm very unimpressed with Skul: Hero Slayer. Though the action elements feel solid, for the most part, each run comes across as relatively unexciting to me.\\n\\nFor one, the levels are premade sets of levels that have little variety in them. The non-boss enemies are punching bags that aren't particularly interesting to fight, and the enemies in each area are merely slightly stronger versions of the same ones in the prior areas. Similarly, there's a variety of mini-bosses, but they're recycled in between areas with you fighting more at the same time in subsequent areas.\\n\\nThe skul concept is relatively fun - you can pick up new skulls to change up your moveset in each run, and they can be upgraded to improve your damage and moves as well, which I appreciate. The artifact system is full of lots of dull stat boosts, though artifacts also have traits that activate if you have enough of the same trait. Unfortunately, there's way too many artifacts and the bonuses aren't enticing enough to attempt to try to do a specific trait build.\\n\\nLastly, the upgrades between runs were something I didn't love either. The difference between starting the game and getting your upgrades are so large that it feels like you're not even really playing the game until you've gotten all of your upgrades, which made me feel like I was wasting my time on artificially hard content.\\n\\nI can't really recommend this game - in most regards, it feels like a more sluggish and less interesting version of Dead Cells (which is ironic because the Dead Cell protagonist is a skull in this game).\",\n",

For one the level design is beyond basic and the areas repeat themselve exactly over and over again. The enemies are mostly fodder and as you advance you will be facing the same kinds of enimies but in a different skin. The combat though it is fun at first gets really repetitive extremely fast.  The things that this game has going for it are the different skulls that you can wear that grants you different abilities. The variety of skulls and the creativeness of the fighting styles and powers associated with these skulls carries this game. You can get some very powerful builds with the right skull and item combination. But alas, this game doesn't have enough to hold my attention for much longer. I know more content is on its way but the issues I have are more based off of its design.  I will check this game out again when it has launched but my hopes are not high for it.\",\n",
       " \"Fun to try for an hour or 2, but I suspect most people will drop this game within a few hours.\\n\\nWhat kills it for me:\\n[list]\\n[*] There are many skulls, but most of them are not viable nor fun. They range from detrimental to use to godly 1-hit-killing AoE. This puts me off more than anything else in game, because many runs start bad and I feel like I might as well end the run when I reach stage 2 with crappiest skulls that lack AoE and/or mobility.\\n[*] Most skulls are aimed for single target damage (they have low/no AoE), but starting 2nd level of the game, you get swarmed by enemies. That means you'll likely get destroyed unless you take the game VERY slow.\\n[*] Upgrade system does not address the 2 problems above, so you rely on getting rare-ish upgrades or good skulls for a successful run.\\n[/list]\\n\\nStages get repetitive fast for a roguelike. I could live with that if the skulls were balanced better.\\n\\n[h1]Update[/h1]\\nI gave the game another try seeing how they advertised revamps for skulls. Nothing much has changed. All of the starter skulls still feel gimped and 2nd stage still requires AoE and mobility that most of the common skulls lack.\",\n",
       " \"Ok look. I like this game but can not honestly recommend it. Not right now. First things first, the game has a few major balance issues with enemies and the skulls you can get. All of them are fun except for the couple that are borderline useless but the most powerful and use full skulls are the shield skull, since he can let you take more damage, the alchemist for his passive and the archlich for his passive. Now that doesn't mean they will win you the game but they are the easiest to use because of how this game swarms you with enemies.\\n\\nSpeaking of enemies, more enemies doesn't mean harder. It can just get to be annoying. For example There are several rooms where it drops you into a room where the entire floor below you is just covered in enemies. It can put you in a situation where you are losing health for no reason other than the amount of enemies around you. Then there are the maids. Look, I just wish they had a little less health or make it so you could have a few more options to deal with them since they are a spawner basically. \\n\\nLook, I know this game can be great and its fun but the big thing is you just need to make a few tweaks and polish it up. I also do know new content is coming and I am super excited for it but please, if you read this, please do give up on this. It is fun and has a lot of potential, So yeah, good luck.\\n\\nEdit: Oh! My! Bloody! God!\\nFirst of, this is the full release? This is how the game is meant to be? Great. Fuck anyone who is trying to get into these types of games. I at least like these types and oh boy do I still not recommend it to veterans of the genre unless they are masochistic.\\n\\nSo to start, let's give the devs some credit. The awaken mechanic is decent. I like the thought put in but there are some issues that I will cover later. I also love the cut scenes. They look amazing and I love the little extra character they add to the world. The random skeletons are also a great touch. I also love the new Yggdrasil fight. The old one was way to slow and repetitive so good job. Oh and the fact that you can tell if an enemy is stun resistant is great.\\n\\nNow for the reasons why I edited this and still don't recommend this game. It feels like you took a step forward and then jumped a mile backwards. First off, why did you think buckling down on the idea that more enemies is a good idea. Filling a room with 30 knights doesn't make it good, just boring and repetitive and the outline that shows they won't be can get covered by other enemies. It feels like some of the damage isn't the players fault and that is a major mood killer for games like this. If a player feels like they are being punished for playing, then they won't play. Also I found a bug that the ninja enemy's attack comes out before the attack animation happens. Also, let's touch on the awakening problem before I forget. Why does it cost so much just to awaken any skull? You get around 10 bones from one that costs 30 to upgrade so why not just let it be half?\\n\\nIf this game gets more love and attention and you fix the enemy problems, I might recommend this game. I just wouldn't recommend it in its current form. Thanks for reading.\",\n",
       " '---- update after another 10h in, and beating the game ---------------\\nI stand by my original review, i beat the final boss with the starting character just for that stupid achievement, game is fun once you hit the end game and have a full understanding, to get there is stupid, the game dosent explain anything to players and gives unfair advantages to enemies, so many of the bosses will hit you mid air before you even attack and they wont signal the attack, so just dash randomly? they can also heal every 10s, the player cannot, so much fun to kill a boss and having to do 3x its hp bar because for half the fight it just sits there sucking on a hp potion, game could be good but the mechanics bring it down\\n\\nI really wanted to like this game, Playd 6h in the first day.  This game is just a RNG grind fest. What i mean by that is, its impossible to beat the game on your first save file, you have to invest gems in to upgrades that honestly they should give you from the start. Such as increasing magic damage by 60%, disenchanting unwanted items for gold. Things that are only in there to make artifical sense of progression in the game. I love old arcade style games where you have 1 shot to beat it, no lives, like spelunky, or metal gear, but this game is nothing like that. just grinding and RNG on top of that to make for a \"fun \" experinece.\\n\\nThe skulls/ different characters are fun but frustrating. You are relying on luck for the character you want, then more luck for the right gear to appear, then even more luck to have enough gold to buy it in the shops. This isnt skill, its just playing the game enough until you get a good run.\\n\\nThe bosses ( i have yet to beat the game just reviewing the first 2 mini bosses and 2 real bosses)\\nI was excited to see such a vast variation in the first mini boss. Theres 3 or 4 different ones you can run in to, Their attack styles varry. one stays in the air the whole time making it jump attacks only, this really sucks depending on your character, another one movers super fast and teleport attacks, bad for slow tanky builds, so more rng for what bosses your run in to can really end your run fast or not.\\nThe first boss i was extreamly dissapointed in, i have already memorized its attack patterns and have achieved a flawless vicotry and the achievement for it. This boss is not fun, its tiring. its two different attacks it has before it ults gets boring fast.\\nFor the 2nd mini boss i was expecting a new boss, something exciting, were in the castle! whos guarding it?!?! the same mini boss from stage one, but this time its two of them at once. This is horible if you are a glass cannon build. There are points where attacks are un dodgeable and you have to take damage. I have no clue who created this game , but i think it may be their first. a player never wants to deligate when to get it, they want to avoid it all togeather. In later on areas the amount of mobs that spawn feel like a endless wave. you cannot see when emeies are attacking because there are so many stacks of them, so you take damage no matter when, even if your roll, even if you counter ( because counter is only 1 attack, not the 6 when you stand still to counter).\\n\\nThe level design has gotten boring after 9h. The rooms are not random, you will come across the same layout room a couple of times in a run. and many times across your full adventure. This game failes to be random where it needs it most to create actual reply ability. Who cares about all the different characters if i cant pick them, who cares about trying to level them up, when i just upgraded my skull for 30 gems but it sells for 11, like really? why make it so grindy and lucky based. A lot of the levels are coverd in spikes, this sure makes it fun, but dont put them on the roof under a platform of enemies, making it so you have to go up there, then when you try a double jump its too high. This wouldnt be a problem if there was a good way of getting hp back. The other traps in the rooms, such as spiked floors that pop out after walking across them are so creative and havent been done before, but they still fail here with enemies not triggering them, so a mob will be idle on it, not agro on to you because the platform is too small, then when you go to fight him, you either avoid the spikes or his hit, or you can stand back and do nothing. great design.\\n\\nThe controls are ok, and thats to put it nicely. It just feels like your mashing the same attack button then occasionally tapping the trigger for a skill, dosent matter what class you are, they all got 1 attack, 1 air attack and thats pretty much it, unless you get good rng and get a legendary, then they have more movesets, but you never get to learn how to use them, the game is so unforgiving. \\n\\nThings that werent thought out. I feel like some things need to be said, Like entering the settings menu and going back to menu, just puts your cursor back at the top of the exit screen, leave it where it was when entering the next screen, a small thing but a pet peve of mine, if your making the game, work out the small bugs. When in the settings menu, if you want to change volume settings you have to scroll all the way down, even though its on the right? just small things like this that make you scratch your head and think, who thought this through. How come it takes holding Y to change skulls in a room, but in the shop area with the free skull, a single tap of Y changes skulls and then you for ever loose the one you had before swapping, where dose it tell the player this? rip reaper run. How come killing a boss without getting hit and getting hit give the same reward? is that even a reward? or are those items that happen to be there, they arent dependant on your skill, like if you clear a room in good time or without getting hit, there should be rewards, that would make this game less rng based.\\n\\nThe HP System sucks, boss\\'s will stand still and tank all damage and suck on a hp potion like a baby with a pacifier, this is not a good game design idea. There are so many un dogeable attacks during a fight, and theres only 1 way to get hp back, and its freaking rng based again, head to the shop and hope you get lucky with a 30% hp potion for all your coins, if your unlucky its a 1% hp potion. Like really? how many other luck factors are needed for a winning run? no skills with characters to get hp back other than wearwolf landing final hit with a certian skill, you can get 1 hp back. and enemies hit for 10. making that 1 hp the one time you land up the skill corectly to have it be the final blow, feel worthless.\\n\\nOther reviews, I dont understand why this game has such a postive rating, Every review on the store that isnt a meme such as \" has skeletons\" has a cons or a flaws section, and its twice as big as the pros section, I get it, it looks like a awesome game, and the sound track in it sounds amazing the first couple times, but once you get down to it, this isnt a good game, people just want to like it.\\n\\nI wouldnt suggest this game for anyone whos looking to 100% it. its just grinding and rng, the levels are repetitive and the bosses get boring after the 3rd go.

This game, when you have a decently upgraded skull, starts being more fun and engaging. sometimes a bit overpowered even. but until then, it's incredibly RNG based. it's more or less an endless grind where you have to get lucky to get far and the only permanent upgrade is a minor stat upgrade.

Nobody needs that.\\n\\nThat being said, it's still a really good game if you don't play it to exhaustion - so if you keep your beginner mind, and just enjoy the lovely skulls, and don't really need all the things I find lacking in it, you're good to go.

The concept of switching your skull to completely change movesets and playstyle is quite unique and overall i quite like the pace of combat. The pixel art is gorgeous and discovering and upgrading new skulls is quite fun. The item system is not bad but its quite clear some synergies and items are much stronger than others and after a while i found myself chasing the same few items.The story is nothing to write home about,like most roguelikes, but especially after Hades, the bar is quite high. \\n\\nHowever the true test  with these games is when the novelty of new things wears off and you reach the endgame. Unfortunately it is at these moments when the flaws become quite apparent. In my opinion the game has a few major problems. Major chunks and aspects of the game mechanics are way too strong or weak compared to others. Barring a few exceptions the entire class of power skulls are way weaker than the other two classes. To add to this, since most power skulls deal physical damage this makes items that buff physical damage much weaker than items that buff magic damage, even with the recent buff to physical items. When it comes to the items themselves,trying to stack most inscriptions also doesn't feel worthwhile and instead you just go for the items that buff damage or provide defensive bonuses.It is also important to note that as you get to the later stages and get stronger , fights cause too many particle effects on screen and it becomes very hard to keep track of your character which makes visual and audio cues nigh impossible to discern. This adds a layer of artificial difficulty that is just plain annoying. Finally there is no late game content other than trying to find and upgrade all the skulls. After you beat the final boss there are no extra modifiers to unlock for endgame content. \\n\\nI'm sure the devs are aware of the flaws and are working to fix them. When they do and add more content to the game , ill change my recommendation to a yes.\",\n",

I really enjoyed checking out the different \"skulls\" (classes) and there was definately neat that each playthrough, different skulls end up having different abilities each time.\\n\\nHowever, there\\'s a Huge (personal) flaw for the game that sorta ruins things for me.\\n\\nLuck. LUCK determines how far I progress, not skill. \\n\\nTo give an example, I couldn\\'t beat the first boss for a good bit. However, in a single run, I just \"happened\" to pull good items, with a good skull, which let me DESTROY the boss, no problem whatsoever. Then died 6 seconds into the castle to a regular enemy.\\n\\nNow, the luck thing goes further. Each \"skull\" can be upgraded by giving \"bones\" to an Arachne you discover  periodically through the stages. However, you only get \"Bones\" (as far as I\\'ve discovered so far) by destroying skulls you don\\'t want to use. Now you can \"sometimes\" get grave stages, but again it comes down to Luck as to weither you actually get the room or not. Skulls give you 5 a pop, and skulls cost a minimum of 10, with a max of 30 to upgrade ONCE, then more to upgrade a second time. As of time of posting (getting to the castle once, figure about 7 runs to the first boss), I\\'ve had as little as 5 bones, to a max of 20.\\n\\nSo in short, LUCK determines if you get \"Good\" skulls that you can use (I\\'m sorry, but the first time I use a class and it gets me past the first boss, that is op/luck, and NOT skill.), LUCK determines if you can even upgrade those skulls, and LUCK that you actually get the skull you want WITH the abilities you want, and LUCK to determine you get powerful items.\\n\\nFor me, there\\'s WAY too much luck involved. lUCK kills rouge games, because the idea is, that over time, and player skill, even \"bad\" players can eventually beat the game, as more skilled players can beat it much faster, without the extra item cruches, which is basically bragging rights. With this one however, even with items/stats, without a \"lucky\" skull find, it was Very hard to beat some of the minibosses, let alone the actual bosses. When Luck is what determines if a player can progress or not, it robs the player of feelings of accomplishment, because they know/suspect their win did not come about because of skill, but rather luck. It sorta ruins the genre. However, luck based runs work fantastically for Rouguelike games, as in those player skill hugely matters, but its also known that luck is a huge factor as well.\\n\\nTL;DR, give it a shot yourself, cool game and I won\\'t refund it, as I want to support the developer, but VERY luck driven rather then skill based.

You most often can't afford to waste fragments and there aren't other mechanisms to upgrade or gain lots of currency. Some form of permanent upgrade could have fixed this and made the game more fun, as one of its problem is staleness/repetition which is amplified by using the same skulls over and over again until you get lucky.\\n\\nI also found the upgrades relatively weak/expensive, forcing the game to become very grindy to make significant improvements. You'll need thousands to make significant improvements (a single 30% respawn option costs 3000) but each run to start is maybe getting you up to 100. There is some luck involved as every once in awhile you can find rooms that will give you a lot of upgrade points (many hundreds at least) - and if you get past the first boss you can expect maybe 200 area. But literally everything is expensive so you have to do many runs to save anything or waste it on 5-6% increment improvements until you can be good enough to go for the bigger upgrades, which again aren't as significant as their price.

You have to make sure your hitbox doesn\\'t connect to stay safe. So the game teaches you to rely on dashing at the beginning but then punishes you for doing that.\\n\\n* Some enemy attacks\\' timings are very unintuitive. This is made even worse by the fact that bosses have two phases with the second phase have the same attacks but with different timings and added effects.\\n\\n* Cooldowns, cooldowns everywhere!

Randomness is why we play rogue-likes!\" True, but in good rogue-likes randomness is both surprising and controllable and allows you to adjust you tactics depending on the situation. This game while having a lot random elements doesn\\'t give you almost any choice. Here are all things you can choose: next room (1 of 2 and half of the rooms doesn\\'t even have the choice!); miniboss reward (1 of 3: skull, essence, passive item, so you can\\'t really plan this aspect); shop item (and most of the time you again have money only for 1 of them and the healing is also a shop item which can even have negative effects!); take or not take a random challenge (see below). So basically most of the time it makes an impression that you have a lot of choices but all of them except one are useless.\\n\\n* Challenges (at least in the first 2 acts) are so hard as if they were an endgame content. To the point that some of them are plain unwinnable with your typical build at this stages. And that\\'s considering I have maxed the permanent attack bonus and invested on some other bits as well. You literally doesn\\'t have enough DPS or HP sometimes. Yes the game have a challenge with unavoidable damage! Fun, isn\\'t it?

You cannot input a direction on the regular attack so you can hit enemies above more easily, or hit enemies below you while in the air, nothing. \\nEven for a roguelike, this relies way too much on luck. Getting a legendary or unique skull is essential to the run, or atleast getting enough bones to upgrade a different skull. \\nAccessories are boring and basically just stat increases. Even legendary tier items are mostly just stat increases. Whats more interesting about the items is the attributes associated with them, but even then, theres not a lot of them either. Also, there is a limited inventory, for some reason, so you cant get a lot of accessories to increase melee or magic damage, meanwhile enemies become even greater damage sponges. My best run so far was stopped on the fourth boss. It took me well over 5 minutes of constant pummeling at a single one of the two pillars before i got killed, and even then i couldnt destroy it. The enemies get too much health late game, and it becomes unfun, and since you cant keep stacking more and more accessories to help deal with even the small fries in later acts, the enemies become more troublesome to deal with. You can't ignore them either. The game wont allow you to progress until all enemies are killed in a stage.\\nSpeaking of acts, there is no variation. The first act will always be the same forest setting, and with its limited amount of stages, you'll be going through the same, recycled stages each run. Atleast have two different settings per act or something, like how risk of rain 2 has 3 or so different environments for each stage you enter. The gameplay becomes repetitive and boring way too early on. \\nAlso, theres no secret acts in this game, so you dont have much of a choice of what you can do each run, unlike, say, enter the gungeon, which has an optional secret floor hidden on each normal floor, so if you wish, you could always go there. That keeps the game fresh, and replayable. \\nThere are, however, 3 secret rooms (That i've found so far), which you encounter completely randomly, further adding to my point of this game relying too much on luck. One of the rooms has a chest in the middle, which contains a strong accessory, but needs a big key to be unlocked, and around the middle chest, are smaller chests, which contain random rewards or stuff that damages you. Basically, even more RNG. \\nAnother secret room has yet another strong accessory in the middle, but once you activate the room, you have to dodge a ton of darts while destroying some dumb obelisks.

Also, if he has projectiles on screen, they will still kill you even if you kill the boss before they explode, so the boss and player might end up killing each other at the same time before the player can pick up the purple crystals. \\n\\nAll in all its grindy, progression is dependent on luck, and there doesn't seem to be a ton of content in the game.

Oh, and if you do badly, and get hit by enemies on stage 4, you'll start to take even more damage, punishing those who are already struggling. And those are only the minions. If some of the regular enemies are damage sponges, the bosses are full-on damage tanks. Boss fights after the first one become tedious more than challenging.\\n\\nWith all of that, you'll find many builds badly outclassed and unable to compete, especially compared to the best ones. Some skulls are downright awful. That is also if you are lucky enough to get the right items for the right skulls. Out of 9 items, some item inscriptions now require 7 to get the full bonus effect. In turn, with the addition of new items, they are now rarer by virtue of the item pool being expanded. As if all that weren't bad enough, they lowered the partial bonuses for the lower end of the inscription levels. The high end got raised, sure, but now the low end is even worse than it was.\\n\\nOn a completely different note, as you get further in the game, you'll start noticing how easy it is to lose your character. Between items, enemies, and abilities, the screen is a veritable mess of obfuscation. Lack of visibility can, and most likely will, get you killed, which is absurd.\\n\\nI really hope with time that the balance will be smoothed out.

There are 12 upgrades with only 3 of them being slightly more than meager (\"+6% Magic Damage\"...), uninspired pittance to health and damage. There are no discernible item unlocks.\\n\\nCurrently, my greatest frustration is with an NPC that offers \"upgrades\" to weaponry you find during runs.

These upgrades are also TEMPORARY.\\n\\nYou get the gist. There are many such design decisions that will leave you scratching your head, wondering why the dev thought it was a good idea.

I want to say one thing about this game though.\\n\\nThe enemies are getting too many buffs.\\n\\nYou aren't really getting any buffs yourself, more like more mechanics to play around with. The game hasn't gotten too hard, but it has certainly gotten very irritating to deal with sometimes.\\n\\nThere are a couple of things that I am a bit sad about for this game.\\n- There are more skills attached to items that make the game chaotic. Most of the time you do not see what's happening due to these effects that make the screen filled with flashes. You used to be able to see when an enemy will attack and such, but with so much going on, you don't know what to expect.\\n\\n- Hero Battles have gotten nearly impossible when a priest is in the battle. The priest will get down to a low enough health, but then heal everyone. This used to be avoided when you could break them out of their special, but now you're not able to due to the buffs these heroes have gotten. Or at least you aren't able to break them that easily. I've gone absolute bonkers on the healer when she prepared her special and she still ends up healing everyone, taking me back to square one. The battles with her are absolutely annoying.\\n\\n- On the upside of items getting their buff, Luck is needed less. However, it didn't decrease by much. You can go through a really good or really bad run and be very annoyed at the fact that it was because of your luck. Don't get me wrong, you can get the worst skulls possible and still make it through. But then those skulls require a lot of physical damage items. Which means you have to get lucky to even get through the barrage of enemies. You will end up mashing a lot, and I do not know if enemies got a defensive buff, but before all this chaotic jazz update with the items, I was able to feel powerful going through enemies. Now i have to keep mashing until they finally die. I feel weak with even Unique Skulls.\\n\\nI do love this game. It's fun, but it used to be simpler and more fun. Now it's chaotic and less fun.\\n\\nHere are recommendations that I think need to happen for this game:\\n- Make a simple mode, I don't like having my items have extra effects that fill my screen up with random stuff.\\n- Make skulls accessible not through the adventure, but through upgrades. This might be a huge change to the game and its factor of luck, but I love certain skulls that are Unique, but have only gotten them once through all the playthroughs of this game.\\n- Make the heroes breakable again, or atleast easier to break. When there's 3 heroes on the screen, I can get through them IF there isn't a priest. The priest heal is ridiculous. It's easier to get through the stage bosses and that says a lot.\\n\\nI've had loads of fun with this game. But its gotten to a point where I feel like the character is always weak. And not in a challenging way. It seems more of a chore to trudge through fodder of enemies that don't take too much damage unless I have the EXACT right items.\\n\\nThe game is a mess right now for me. I don't recommend getting it right now. Unless you want to save money because it's price will go up after its 1.0 update.\",\n",

The fact that you're losing 95% (5% are NPCs and Dark Quartz) of your loot and progress just isn't very satisfying at all. I would really love to see some checkpoints here and there. For example right after the Ent Lord, because then dying at the stages after and then having to redo the bossfight just doesn't make sense to me.\\n- Secondly (This is just my taste, so it probably won't match everybody's thoughts) I think the Soundtrack for the Carleon Forest stages is very unfitting. By now I kinda got used to it but seeing this absolutely stunning pixelart and then hearing this weird happy EDM-ish music just doesn't match up for me. I do need to say that for the rest of the stages I've been at so far the soundtrack is very enjoyable.\\n- I'd also love seeing some kind of healing potion or something like that which you could purchase from somebody in the shop segment. Of course this would make the game a lot easier but to compensate that you could just increase the healing potions price or something.\\n\\nThat's my Feedback.

       " 'An overly difficult and grindy roguelike that is ultimately killed by the RNG of skull drops. I had fun with this game for a while until I realized you do not get viable skulls anywhere close to even an uncommon drop rate. It seems like the skulls you get just about every run are severely low damage skulls with long recovery on animations whose very slight damage increase from the base skull is not worth it. This feeds into the roguelike nature of it which would be fine if stat progression wasn\\'t this slow. You need the dark crystals to pump into damage increases but this stuff drops in very little quantity and in such few rooms that getting enough to actually make a difference on any stat requires multiple runs. Runs in which you get useless skulls meaning your damage is way below what the progression system expects you to have making acquiring crystals that much more difficult. Speaking of sparse currencies; you can get gold which only stays during that run however items and skulls in the pre-boss rooms are so expensive to the point that if you hit only treasure rooms you might have enough for a heal and that\\'s it. You probably won\\'t be able to afford an item to help you and there\\'s no guarantee you can trade in your skull for a new one leaving you maybe at full health and with no benefits going into some rough fights. Now there are characters to recruit to get items or skulls at the beginning however none of the items or skulls you can get before starting a run are of any worth, especially since trading in that skill isn\\'t a guarantee if you make it that far. There is a way to power up skulls however it is not permanent and costs a ton of that crystal currency which means you have to make a choice on upgrading a fairly worthless skull or your stats. All of this combined with the utterly ludicrous damage that enemies can do to you inflates this games artificial difficulty. It\\'s designed to be an unfairly difficult and overly repetitive grind fest where the success of your run is ultimately decided by pure luck. I wanted to like this game after seeing Jirard \"The Completionist\" Khalil show it off during IndieLand 2020 but I really can\\'t stand by these design choices.

But guess what? You eventually progress and new enemies make things a little exciting again! And then... you realize they are just reskinned, harder versions of enemies you have already encountered. Until you run into the maids.\\n\\nArt and animation is excellent. Controls are very tight. Soundtrack is good, but definitely gets VERY repetitive. Quintessence can be very unintuitive, sometimes detrimental, in combat. It functions as a distraction from important dashing and dodging in most cases. Some skulls are so worthless, you are better off with your base abilities just so you can keep the essential ability to quickly dodge and engage enemies by throwing your head (I made it farthest in this game picking up ZERO skulls).\\n\\n*** I think combat can be drastically improved by either lowering the recharge rate on the player\\'s dash, or allowing the player to dash twice before it recharges. Dashing is essential to the defensive gameplay, but feels way too limited.\\n\\nThis is a well made game with some great ideas and I really want to enjoy it. But some design decisions have made it feel repetitive and annoying. I wish there was a 3rd \"Try it first.\" or \"Maybe\" recommendation in Steam for cases like this because it does deserve a look if you are into action roguelikes, but I feel a good number of players will be pushed away by it eventually, whether they like the game or not. \\n\\nThis is a golden age for action roguelikes, and it\\'s an easy recommend for many of them lately.

You progress through a stage by fighting filler enemies and doing platforming challenges. At the end of a stage you get to choose a door you enter that will have a set reward at the end (except when they decide you only get one option).

Some are magic base, some are melee, some are ranged, some are a mix ect. Some skulls are worse than the skull you start off with, others are INCREDIBLY powerful. You can also power up skulls by using bone fragments at certain times to power up your skulls. Problem is you'll never know if you're going to get those more powerful skulls, and whats worse is that the rarity of the skull decides how many bone fragments you can get. So you have a system where you can't reliably get a rarer skull or bone fragments to upgrade the more basic skulls. So at face value your path to power is luck based and their little you can do about it.\\n\\nBUT WAIT THERE'S MORE. Each skull has a pool of usable abilities, and THOSE too can vary in quality as well. These abilities are important because they provide a lot of damage and utility. The problem again is that some abilities a skull has are much better than others.

The archer is better than the other 2, but still bad. The fact that you can keep yourself safe is nice, but you can only shoot 1 enemy at a time, and the damage is much worse than melee too. That's why clearing a room with ranged skulls feels really bad and takes much more time.\\n2) Sword/flame/wolf skulls are bad imo. Sword and flame skulls will stand still after you switch them and that's bad. At least the skills of flame skull are good, so it's still usable. Wolf will teleport after switching. Lol, why? Dodging boss's skills? \\n3) Some mid bosses are obviously easier than others. The archer and priest are the easiest. Then the ninja and wizard. The sword one is the most powerful. Haven't got to the final boss of 2nd zone so i am not sure if there are others.\\n4) This game depends a LOT on luck. Something that's bad in this genre. The problem with bosses aside, there is common and rare for everything. Rares are more powerful but of course, less frequent. So if you are lucky and get 2 good and rare skulls and some good items that work with them (items that buff attack based on skull type) , the game will be much easier.

Here\\'s why.\\n\\nAction roguelites are about finesse - dodge and weave through enemies finding the right times to strike. Skul tries to appear as such, but in actuality is no more than a dps check. For example, there is a point in every run where you have to fight 3 randomized bosses at the same time. You\\'re going to get hit many times, no exceptions. The only survival is killing them fast enough. \\n\\nThat\\'s the core of the game. Fight a dozen enemies at once each with different attacks, but no matter how well you memorize attack patterns, you cannot focus on dodging any of them without getting hit by the other 11. Not to mention there\\'s no I-frames on hit, so expect to get oneshot by a single attack hitting you multiple times. Game design of each room is cruel and unfun, always forcing you through tight spaces to kill enemies with massive area attacks that pass through walls.\\n\\nWhat\\'s worse is how the game handles a player\\'s power. \"Skulls\" that are the core of your build are either useless or absolutely destroy rooms. Items give you ridiculous attack power, and having that exponential power is required, so if you take any of the few defensive items the game offers you, you lose as soon as you hit a DPS check bossfight. If you happen to make it to the later floors, your strength completely plateaus, since your item total caps at nine. \\n\\nBut no matter how strong your build may be, runs are still hopeless. Even in runs where you mow down enemies effortlessly, the quantity and variety thrown at you force you to take hits. In Skul, there\\'s almost no healing and if you take 10 hits, you\\'re done. What this means is you lose out on the biggest part of roguelites - the feeling of strength and power. You don\\'t get any dopamine from finding a great legendary if you know you\\'re still screwed.\\n\\nHow this game actually has a following is beyond me.\\nAt no point during my 13 hours was the game fun, and I have no interest in wasting my time any longer.\\n\\nDo not buy.',\n",

       " 'So, I have played this game for a tiny bit and you might see all those achievements. I cheated. But let me give you Skul in a nutshell.\\n\\nSkul: The Hero Slayer is a rogue-light which you play a skeleton man who can pop his head off and pick up new skulls to change class. 90% of the skulls range from terrible to slightly less terrible and only a few are passable in regards to being good enough to get past the second boss.\\n\\nPlaying without cheating and running into a brick wall every time for the second boss, I decided to give my self in cheat engine 100+ bones. Bones are a currency you use in the game to upgrade your class. Now, I thought \"Gee, maybe I can like, try all the classes at max level and see which ones are good and which ones I should just restart the run early.\" - And guess what? Every class except for like, 2 of them, are crap. But the problem with bones is by the time you get enough without cheating, you will be right near the end of the game.\\n\\nSo, let me lay it on you. Skul: The Hero Slayer is pretty much only beatable if you grab a very early legendary skull, such as the Gambler. Now you might say \"Gee, sperg. You might just be bad at video games and terrible\". That could be true! But I think I\\'m not too terrible at video games and even when getting to the end of Sekiro, I still felt like it was challenging, but fair. Skul? Skul is not fair and the insane amount of grinding you need to do in runs to get better passive everlasting bonuses takes way too long. Other rogues such as Binding of Issac, you will feel like you are slightly making progress with every run and unlocking new items. Skul? Skul you will run twenty million times to get a +1% damage bonus. Yippie.\\n\\n You will start off your run - Get something terrible like a shield skull, and you might as well restart until you get something legendary. Let\\'s talk about traits as well. You see, legendary rare skulls are not enough to get ahead in this game, you also need items which provide traits. Traits also range from 99% garbage to a few that are worth picking up and you can only have so many items equipped at once. Traits are leveled by having similar items share the same trait keywords. Say you pick up a rod that has the traits (Lava) and (Gamergirl Pee) - Now, these have a number like 0/5 - If you pick up enough items with (Lava) keyword, you will get a passive effect like fireballs will peridoically shoot out of you and the more you have the trait the lower the cooldown.\\n\\nFor another cheating experiment, I decided to give my self 90000 gold. Now, most levels you will get like, max 2k gold. With all this insane gold, I decided to run the item shop restock over and over to see how long it took me to get the \"fairy spirit\" or whatever trait maxed which I believe to be the best trait in the game currently. Needless to say, I spent all 90000k and was still missing a piece. Oh no!  \\n\\nIf you don\\'t get a really rare skull/trait combo? Well tough cookies, bro. Because now you do about 1 hit per swing and every single enemy in this game is a HP sponge. This gets insanely obnoxious when you get a terrible combo and you legit are spending about twenty minutes just trying to ping down an enemy one floor below you, who\\'s AI isn\\'t good enough to jump up and attempt to attack you.\\n\\nSo, would I recommend Skul? I don\\'t know, man. For a rogue it\\'s actually pretty terrible right now - But! I think with time and a few patches, it could be a great game.

       " 'This game has potential there\\'s no doubt about that. \\n\\nHowever, right off the bat it is too difficult and unforgiving even on the first area. There is no proper way to regain HP or it\\'s too vague because you only get it on some kills from the enemies. The Dash mechanic shouldn\\'t have to be upgraded in order to to deal with enemies. I felt like the difficulty would just spike on some points and I would lose more health from one attack than a similar attack. \\n\\nI only made it to the first boss because the skull I had was the Minotaur which gave me a boost in health and defense and every other skull up until then was mediocre and felt more like a downgrade than an upgrade. The game is too harsh in the beginning and I feel the difficulty at the moment would scare off newer players because it seems like you need to have experience in these types of games to make any progress. There\\'s no fun in dying over and over and only making a bit of progress if you don\\'t even get anything out of it except stronger enemies. \\n\\nI believe one major change should be that the dash should already offer invincibility frames or alternatively make the controls more fluid because they feel so stiff and only certain skulls allow better mobility than others. It makes since that ninja is faster than the Minotaur but it should feel like you have to commit on an action that could\\'ve been changed in a split second. Others may say differently on changes and that already having invincibility frames would make the game too easy as you\\'d just be able to no hit without having a problem. To this regard they say you need to \"get gud,\" however, the difference between this game and hollow Knight is that there was actually a way to avoid enemies and spikes even without the shadow cloak.\\n\\nI believe this game has the potential to be a great game but right now it\\'s too unforgiving and hard even at the start.

So definitely wait for a sale before getting it.  Plus game still doesn\\'t have a save feature during runs which is just so pathetic and sad.  Unless you are a super skilled speed runner, full runs can take 2 hours, and it\\'d be nice like so many other games to have a save option but instead play like its 1990, no saves and no passwords for progress.\\n\\nOverall I don\\'t recommend it as its not very fun.  This game has a lot of hype, but don\\'t listen to that. It\\'s really just okay.  It is a very frustrating game and the rogue like elements feel tacked on.  Like they made a decent 2d slasher and decided they could make a few more dollars by adding in basic and worthless roguelite elements to it.  A shame because had they focused on making it fun instead it could have been great.\\n\\nBossess and room designs have massive issues.  Some sprites are really ugly, like just pathetic.  And they don\\'t do enough to make this visible as you deal with millions of things on top of each other.  Hitboxes also can be REALLY bad.  Not miles away bad, but clearly visibly it looks like it shouldn\\'t have connected but some invisible frames must continue to exist pre and post to visual colision.\\n\\nStory is like many rogue-lite games not very deep.

My family was about to have my last rites read to me pull the plug.(I\\'m sure some of you would love that. lol Keep dreamin\\')\\n\\n- Abilities/Movement/Speed. These abilities suck. I literally had 9 add-ons adding at the very least 15% to my physical attack, in the third form as Werewolf. Let me tell you this, I\\'ve seen people hit vape\\'s harder. Dust landing on a cloud in heaven hits harder than this character ever will. Movement speeds I feel are fair somewhat. But the RNG thrown into this is utterly ridiculous. You might be saying \"What RNG? You said it\\'s memorizing muscle movement\" Now this wouldn\\'t be an issue if you weren\\'t left with the complete b-hole option of getting random abilities. Especially once you save a couple of characters. The Wolf, that witch, and Ogre. The Wolf and Ogre always give you a free ability and skull. But as you guessed it, you will always be given the worst of the worst nonsensical b.s. ability and skull to start. I.E. You will be given a Magic based skull and a physical based ability. Or vice versa. EVERY single time. This has happened in over 30 straight runs. Nothing ever compliments one another. The ENT boss...this is a good example also. Let\\'s say you\\'re not given any skulls up until this that allow your character mobility or a decreased speed. You are not going to beat both phases of this boss. First of all your huge slow crap character cannot move quick enough to dodge that bosses attacks properly. So you\\'re almost guaranteed to be slow enough to take at least some damage on every attack. I get it\\'s supposed to be difficult and it\\'s an achievement in defeating it without damage....my point is you can only do that with certain builds. Actually only maybe 1-3 specific builds. Otherwise there\\'s a good chance of death. This sucks in two respects, it\\'s unbalanced and is a subtle \\'slavery replay\\' Instead of you actually wanting to sit down and grind this out, you feel forced to, even in order to beat the game one time. It\\'s not so much about skill, movement, dodging, etc as it is about getting a lucky build, having all the enemy movements memorized, and knowing the distance of every movement of your character or if you play enough times and get enough points you can make this character so OP you can blow through most everything and eventually beat the game.\\n\\nEither way, I feel like the time invested in this would not be worth it as this point. It\\'s not the most disappointing thing I have ever seen come out of Early Access. But it\\'s not the best either. I can play a run or two before wanting to be a pr*ck to the dead/un-dead.',\n",

So I opened the menu to reverse this nuisance and for some reason next to the option of changing language they putted the  dramatical option of redefining local saves, I naively clicked on it believing that the option asked \"Yes\" or \"No\" to redefine the settings to Portuguese  again but instead of that I ended up deleting my save that had 44 hours of Gameplay and hard work, only being able  to finish  the game once.\\nFirst of all, I tried to check the local saves of the game in the folders so I could rescue the old save, but the game had already done  a New Save Backup, so I went to Reddit and I found some other people with the same case or similar of mine , with that  I concluded that there was no point in researching more trying to save my files so  I ended up not  recovering my save.\\n\\nI leave my non-recommendation to this game not only for what it has caused to me, but also for  neglecting something that should be so simple today.

       " 'First rating at 1h30 of playing : \\n\\nShort opinion : not bad but generic visuals & music, bland gameplay, tedious progression. \\n\\nDetailed opinion : \\n- graphics are nice, animations and design are somewhat generic however. It feels like a game I could\\'ve seen already. The exact same for music : not bad but very generic. \\n- gameplay isn\\'t a fluid as it could be. Your character is slowed down after dashing / when attacking, enemies\\' attack cues and hitboxes aren\\'t clear, cooldowns take forever. Many weapons besides the starting one are even slower.\\n- exploration feels bland. It\\'s a succession of (non randomly generated) rooms, and in 1h30 of gameplay I\\'ve already seen some rooms almost 10 times. Always with the exact sames enemies at the exact same spot.\\n- progression feels teeeeedious. In 1h30, I started about 10 runs; I could only get the 1st boss killed 1 time, and got 2 skill points to spend, just enough to upgrade my damage input by a whooping 12% (instead of hitting 8 I hit 9...) and nothing else. So basically no progression in 1h30. Looting also seems broken, if you don\\'t get a room with a pile of gold, enemies drop so little that you won\\'t be able to buy anything worth during your run. \\n- there\\'s no definite mood to the story, or even the game so far. There\\'s a bit of humor here and there, but other than that, nothing feels glorious, mysterious, heroic, sad, tragic, poetic ... meh. \\n\\nSo not a bad game, but honestly something I could\\'ve played in early 2010\\'s on a browser. By then it would have been a very fine game, but since then we\\'ve gotten Dead Cells, Rogue Legacy 1 & 2 ... Skul feels like an attempt to copy this kind of rogue-like quality, but it\\'s nowhere as captivating.\\n\\n\\nAdditionnal comments at 7h30 of playing : \\n- the gameplay isn\\'t as frustrating as it was, but it\\'s still not satisfying either; I still get lots of hit I can\\'t see coming\\n- same goes for progression : I did get a bit of progress (reached area 2, with some VERY frustrating enemies) but I don\\'t really feel powerful either, and area 1 is still a chore to get through\\n- still no mood, no story, etc. I only got a <10 frames backstory cinematic at the reach of area 2, that\\'s 1 minute or story per 5 hours of gameplay ...\\n- also a \"fun\" thing I noticed : boss of area 1 is a cheap version of The Giant from dead cells, and boss from area 2 is a cheap version of Mantis Lords from Hollow Knight...

       " \"I've played many roguelikes and roguelites and this one is the most boring of them all. I was expecting a lot more from this game but the gameplay is slow and when it's not it's hard because it's hard to read and you have to memorise them and I just don't have the time for memorising a game that is boring. Also changing your skull every time you play makes it hard to learn your attacks and skills and many attacks of many skulls just take way too long to execute, making you get hit because your enemy was faster than you. For someone who didn't play that many roguelikes, maybe this game wouldn't feel that bad to play but it's really really boring because both enemies and skulls are just slow as hell. Also if you find a good skull at the beginning of the game you are gonna have an easy time progressing and if you don't then it's gonna be a lot harder so it also feels really unballanced. Another bad thing is instead of giving you normal enemies the game gives you maybe 10 enemies in the same spot but they can't hit you if you stun lock them so most enemies feel absolutely pointless to fight against. It's like developers knew that the enemies couldn't do anything so they throw more enemies at you but it doesn't change anything. The game gets a lot easier after upgrades but upgrading your character takes way too long and most of the time you just get a really small stat upgrade so you don't even notice the difference after one upgrade. Everything about this game is boring unless you get a good skull and you are in the late game areas, only then the game gets fast and exciting but it feels like a chore to get there. Overall just boring and uniteresting. 4/10\",\n",
       " 'This game has a lot of fun but also so much jank that it covers up a lot of the fun aspects.\\nProblems\\nSkulls\\nThe skulls are an interesting idea with the different skulls allowing lots of playstyles with the swap mechanic encouraging mixing and matching skulls. But there are multiple issues with this system. One is that individual skulls are often poorly designed, and the second is the lack of resources. To elaborate on the first issue, many skulls are objectively worse than others. I’m not talking about rarity but in fundamental design. Some skulls have attacks with long windup animations which makes them functionally unusable due to being unable to use their attacks in large combat encounters. Most power skulls are like this and while some may have ways to solve it such as warriors being given I frames during skills. It still doesn’t solve the main issue that almost every enemy attacks faster than the skull.Other skulls simply lack damage and are objectively worse compared to many other skulls in the same category. The second problem ties into this issue. The game discourages experimentation with the stingy amount of materials it gives the player. It takes 140 bones to upgrade a common skull to a legendary skull. It takes 100 bones from unique to legendary. However, a unique skull only gives 20 bones. This leads to a resource issue where there are almost never enough bones to level two skulls concurrently. Only one skull can usually be leveled to legendary unless you get lucky. This means that swap mechanics are almost never used efficiently as there often isn’t a good skull to swap into. This leads to praying that RNG will give you a good skull and enough resources to level it. Even common skulls aren’t guaranteed to appear in a run.\\nControls\\nThe controls for this game are extremely unpolished. Arial movement is almost non-existent with no way to effectively move in the air. This wouldn’t be a problem if not for the large number of enemies on the ground. Another problem is the Dash. The dash is the primary defensive skill allowing for invincibility frames to dodge attacks. It has a few problems however. It’s extremely difficult to tell when the dash comes off cooldown leading to you mashing the dodge button while you get hit because you couldn’t tell if the dash was off cooldown. Another problem is that the dash animation doesn’t exist. It propels you forward without one for many skulls. This makes it extremely difficult to tell where the dash ends and can make movement feel off. The jumping is also not great with no variable jump height which would be fine but platforms don’t feel adjusted to how high you can jump. They feel as if they are placed arbitrarily which leads to you jumping around to see if you can make the jump when you either can’t or you easily clear the height and go way too far up. Overall, the controls don’t feel optimized.\\nEnemies\\nThis is the main issue with the game. The enemies don’t feel like they fit the style of this game. The game feels like it should be a hack and slash type of game. This is due to the amount of cannon fodder enemies and the large area attacks which most skulls have. However, the game also places lots of enemies which feel out of place in this design. Act 4 demonstrates this the most with the game placing cannon fodder knights with spearmen who can sweep across the entire floor along with priests who fire homing projectiles or fill the screen with them along with assassins who teleport to your location with a quick attack. These enemies would be fine on their own as enemies who require more attention. The issue is the game uses all of them at the same time. This leads to a situation of information overload where it is functionally impossible to dodge all attacks due to the large amount of them and the visual stimuli. Enemies also gain inflated health values throughout the game with act 3 and act 4 gaining massive attack and health values that do not match the damage you can deal. \\nRNG\\nThis is the main issue that ties into every single issue and turns the game extremely sour. You need extremely good RNG. While the studio has tried to fix the issue by adding more choices when choosing items. It doesn’t really solve the issue. They made the odds better but they’re still terrible. If you get bad RNG with items or skulls, there is no way to recover. Enemy health values will rise while your damage will remain low. The main issue is that there is nothing in the players control. Your moveset and items are completely out of your control and you have no agency in choosing it. This leads your runs to be decided more by numbers than skill.\\nConclusion\\nThis game has many fundamental issues that hold it back from being recommended. The skull system, while interesting, does not allow for enough experimentation and few skulls are worth using. The movement system is poorly designed and does not allow the player to move efficiently or dodge easily. There are often too much visual stimuli which makes it hard to dodge attacks. There are too many complex enemies each with unique gimmicks which lead to situations where you have to get hit. Everything in the game is decided by RNG with nothing being left up to the player meaning that skill matters much less than luck. Overall, I don’t recommend this game when there are so many better roguelikes like Dead Cells.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Really just a mix of other games, but worse.  Almost the whole game is like dead cells.  Also basically same concept, being kill, collect, die, and reset.  Dead cells is very fun and funny, if you get the jokes.  The 2nd boss fight (not including the little heros like the priest and the zelda guy) is just like the mantis lords in hollow knight and the queen from dead cells.  They made it feel so much like the mantis lords with them doing a quick attack then leaving the screen, and the queen because of the little slashes on the screen that come back latter.  Also forgot to mention that a 2nd stage move is a lot like the argus boss in neon abyss, with the little eyes that shoot lasers.  The map is bland and takes too long to load.  Controls suck even if you try out changing them around.  Also has no secret zones.  All you do is hope you get a legendary skull.  Basically this whole review summed up about this game is that the maps are crap, the 2nd boss is just a huge mix up of bosses from other games, and just no fun to really play.  If the devs see this review ( even though that is not gonna happen) a way to improve your game is by making the maps load quicker if you have a old pc, making the game funny, not making the game feel like work instead of fun, and make the bosses unique.

They are Passives that have multiple levels to them the more items you collect that share the same Inscription the stronger they get.

If you do a run with neither of these skills the enemies will eventually be so bullet spongy you will just want to restart.\\n\\nVisuals are some of the best but its not a saving grace for the game. There is an easy mode but all it does is make you take less damage. There is a dodge mechanic in the game but its not very good, some bosses or enemies attack so fast that you will get hit anyway because there is a mechanic in place to not allow you to dodge so many times in a row. Depending on the skull you can dodge 1-3 times, once you dodge your maximum it will have a cooldown so it feels more like dodge the attacks that hit the hardest & tank the weakest.\\n\\nThis game lets you equip 2 Different Skulls in a run that can be upgraded with different rarities. Common (3 upgrades) Rare (2 upgrades) Unique (1 upgrade) & Legendary (0 upgrades). Upgrade are for the current run only & cost change from 10, 30, 100 bones. Bones can only be gotten from very special unique rooms like a giant chest, special Harpy NPC & breaking down other Skulls you don\\'t want from the Green Rooms or after a boss. The rarity will determine how many bones you get when breaking it down & if you decide to break down a Skull you upgraded but don\\'t want anymore you don\\'t get back the bones you spent to upgrade it you get less, its a net loss.

There's no way to ensure better drops, so you're going to be dying or restarting a lot.\\n-There are ways to upgrade your lower-level skulls along the run, but it's also pretty RNG-based because the amount of upgrade material you get depends on the quality of the skulls you find and discard. (You'll almost never have the amount of materials needed to upgrade a skull at your first opportunity.)\\n-It takes a lot of grinding to get the permanent powerups. \\n-The grinding becomes stale because there are only a few enemy types, a few stage layouts, and one end boss per biome.

       " 'This is by no means a bad game, so I don’t feel too great about this review, but this rating seems incorrect to me, and steam gives us no better option than up or down.  On the positive side, I love the variation with skulls, items, and power-ups. I love the art-style, music, and even find the story attractive. In all these ways the game deserves a positive rating… just not an overwhelmingly positive one. \\n\\nThat said, here are my issues:\\nFor a roguelite, a full mission run is on the long side. On a really lucky run, it’s taken me 1hr 20 min to clear the map; and in the last game I found myself wanting to die at the ~70 min mark because it was just taking too long. Hades and Isaac both found run-time sweet spots, this one takes more of a rogue legacy approach, but is considerably more aggressive when it comes to damage. This comes to a second issue that I need to break down into points.\\n\\nThe game is a little on the pretentiously difficult side. \\nThis is a 2D platformer bullet hell, where survival is really predicated on one’s ability to jump dash constantly. It becomes difficult to see all that’s happening on the screen and you have considerably less space for maneuverability than say Hades or Isaac because it’s a 2D side-scroller. \\n\\nThe boss difficulty is relatively equitable to hollow night, with the 4th level boss taking more than a little inspiration from radiance. Most bosses have 2 stages, one has 1 + new abilities, another has 3. Each stage has a miniboss stage. This creates situations where, in order to get the time you need to learn the bosses patterns, you need to invest way too much time getting to that part. I learned by using cheat engine, becoming invincible, playing defensively, learning patterns – but in its natural state, the game doesn’t really allow this without a larger time investment. For the record, I played on easy.\\n\\nThe RNG is a little on the tedious side, in that a broad family of skulls probably can’t be won with. A core dynamic involves a constant swapping, and upgrading, which will be heavily constrained by item loadout. This isn’t a dealbreaker, but some skulls deserve more buffs or removal from the rotation.\\n\\nThe rogue-lite upgrades are tedious. At the beginning there’s a very slow grind to upgrade base stats and some of these feel more like penalties you remove than abilities your unlock. There’s not really any variation here (like we see with Isaac & Hades) in so far as you can’t set up configurations that would lend themselves to a specific playstyle, and this feels like a wasted opportunity. These could extend to settings that favor families of skull (e.g. speed, power, balance, magic, physical).\\n\\nTo this end, the difficulty options are inadequate. There’s one setting that reduces enemy damage by 50%, but this is a really blunt approach to a nuanced problem, when I could be broken into components (e.g. reduce number of boss states, limit miniboss types, provide 0.2 sec invulnerability after damage, gain one additional life, add/limit number of levels per stage).  I think this game has tremendous potential to be more versatile in this respect.\\n\\nBasically, I would like it if the game had more options that let the player approach it on their own terms, with the expectation that portion of the player base lacks hyper-twitch reflexes and/or doesn’t have the time to commit to an extended get-gud period, or even protracted play sessions for that matter. If some of this changes I will happily change my review, because this game really has promise. \\n',\n",

It's rough because I feel like the game has its own charms, but everything just gets so repetitive and I started feeling that way after only a couple of hours played.  The skull system is an interesting idea, but most of the skulls just feel weak or useless.  YMMV, but like I said, just get Dead Cells if you want a superior game.\",\n",

You'll see every room available in each locale after about 5 runs or so of said locale. The only other RNG is what items you receive / see in the shop. And thats not really a good thing, since most items are hot garbage.\\n\\n2) Boring/ unrewarding endgame.\\n Though the characters and story are very charming, and the mechanics start to feel VERY satisfying after about 10 hours or so, that satisfaction starts falling off during the latter half of the game. The locales look cool and feel epic as you progress, but, your experience and mechanics are not rewarded. End game enemies will shit on you in hordes of 20+, your i-frames and dodges will matter less because of the sheer number of enemies with new attacks you are up against, and it will take you another hour to get back to that spot and figure out what those enemies even do. After hours and hours of returning to that spot, you'll realize its more worth your time to just RNG a build that insta-kills rooms and prevents you from seeing any attacks from the endgame enemies at all.\\n\\n3) No replayability\\n This really just summarizes my first two points, but after you finally conquer the final boss ( who is an absolute bitch and half, I still dont know the hitboxes of 90% of its attacks) you have learned enough about the game to know that the majority of builds will not beat the final boss, let alone even reach that point of the game. There is no point in replaying the game with alternate builds, because you'll just be punished for it. What you might think is a fun and powerful build, will end up flopping on the final boss, making you feel like you just wasted an hour of your time. Its not because your mechanics are bad, or you dont know enough about the game, its because the endgame is just really busted, and you need to have an even more busted build to survive.\\n ---------------------\\nI regret spending more than 20 hours on this game, because thats when my fun ran out. The last 30ish hours was just trying to get to the final boss over, and over, and over again, until my build was busted enough to clear it without me having to lift a finger. It would take 100 more hours for me to get to a point were i could actually clear the game with a non-optimal build by skillfully using the games mechanics. And i would never want to to do that, because playing every single locale and every single boss in the exact same order every single run is an absolute drag.\",\n",

To me nothing really motivates you to play as every single skull, especially with the fact that there is just flaws with a decent amount of them. For instance, most power skulls in the game aren't fun to play. They are not just clunky but they don't as much damage as you would expect them to. The warrior is just straight up the worst skull in the game. He's clunky, his whole gimmick isn't even good, and he's also really boring to play. Other skulls do feel nice to play I have to admit, but a couple of them have the potential to be really fun but aren't executed well either in how they feel or how theyre gimmick works. The stages, enemies, and level design are also lacking. Yes, it is chapter based but at the same time it's the same bosses every run, same exact enemies, in the same room, over and over again. It's not like other rougelite games where the rooms sort of complement the enemies, or the enemies complement each other its just enemies running at you with 1 or 2 patterns and that's it. The levels are the same also and after about 5 hours of playing you can understand what enemies will show up in each level. Those are my main gripes about the game and it's honestly not really fun to play. No motivation to continue this game.\",\n",

There are so many rooms and most of the bosses have multiple phases, it seems more like a gauntlet than a rogue-like, your just trying to see how far you can get before your health just drops to zero. The only consistent healing your going to get in this game is a 10 health orb that drops at random, and when you can have a maximum of 150 health without items, its pretty pointless, especially since enemies will be hitting your for at least double that in the later stages of the game. The only other consistent way to heal is in the shop, but you have to buy it with gold, and the amount that it heals for is random depending on the food item you buy. Other than that, their are 1 or 2 items that allow you to heal, that aren't very good by the way, but you get items buy chance, so the odds of getting them are slim. Most other rogue-likes have reliable healing in the game, so it doesn't feel like your doomed when your health is low.

Enemies are capable of inflicting a rapid death from a hundred tiny cuts, and bosses from the second level onward require a fetish to actually enjoy their masochistic tuning. If your movement or timing is off even a little once it\\'s boss time, you\\'ll most likely fail the run.\\n\\nThere is currency that carries over between runs for hereditary \"upgrades\", but those bonuses are meager and give little in the way of a noticeable power spike. There is no way to grind your way to smoother runs, as you might in other roguelikes. The only hope you have is in finding the right combination of relics and skulls.\\n\\nSkul can equip two skulls, each of which has its own abilities. He can swap back and forth between the two as needed mid-combat; in fact, many skulls are most powerful with rapid swapping. Skulls have potency tiers: Common, Rare, Unique, and Legendary. Practically, though, you\\'ll only find success with Unique and Legendary skulls, as the power gap between the first two tiers and the second two tiers is massive. You can upgrade Common and Rare skulls to give them additional abilities and strengthen existing abilities, but even when upgraded they pale in comparison to the abilities you get from the top tier skulls. \\n\\nThis is Skul\\'s biggest weakness: it is so difficult that unless lady luck smiles on you along the way, you have next to no chance of progressing beyond even the early game. Cruelly, Skul will honey pot you, giving you the false impression that you\\'ve put together a strong collection of skulls and relics, only to stand on your neck once it comes boss time, as you realize just how ineffective certain skulls can be. \\n\\nThere are folks out there who will enjoy this. Bosses have patterns, although they have a lot of them, and you can squeak by after learning their routines, though most of them are bullet sponges that will delete you after only a few missteps without high tier skulls and relics to pump out the damage to down them first. Skul gives you absolutely nothing and will slap you in the face for even suggesting it hold your hand. \\n\\nHowever, if you aren\\'t the sort of person who wants to spend hours failing to make inches of progress and wants to feel as if the time you spend with a game will actually yield some form of return on investment, Skul isn\\'t for you.

I rarely had the feeling of making progress with a losing run, it was always learning enemy patterns, and then get beaten by enemies which patterns I had not yet nailed down. Start a new run only to get beaten by the same enemies after another 25~ minutes. Rinse and Repeat. Healing is very hard to come by, so there's very little room for error.

I would have to manually go to restart for it to continue.  About 20% of the time, it would see me die and give me the death stat page, but then it would go to a black screen and soft lock.  I could hear the music, and it would give me menu selection sounds, but that's it.  The only way i found out of this was to hard quit the game and go back in.  Sometimes this would lose me 2 runs worth of progress because it wouldn't do any type of save.

The upgrade screen would never update the visuals when i made purchases.  i would have to exit the menu and talk to the person again for it to actually show my upgrades. \\n\\nEven when you look beyond the bugs, it is still a very average game at best.  i found the different skulls to be imbalanced.

The randomness of items/skulls/money would lead to games where i would get tons of tons of money, but nothing decent to spend it on in the shops, even with the re-buys. \\n Or none of the skulls they gave me were good ones, and the items just didn't line up to make a decent run.  Even in a game like Dead Cells, you could usually make a decent run with what you came across most the time.  I didn't get the same vibe while playing this.  \\nThere were too many enemies on the screen at once, and visual indications for their attacks just became impossible.  In the later levels, it just led to spamming attacks with decent skulls and hoping you didn't get hit.  I'm no stranger to rogue like/lite games, but this just seems very sloppy.  Timing windows for attacks/dodge in combination with low indicators made it hard to even no-hit large bosses.

       " '(I will update this review if the game changes as it updates.)\\nAn almost fun roguelike that quickly turned repetitive and grindy. One of the main issues with the game is that the progression system basically comes down to slowly increasing stats by small increments for increasingly ridiculously high amounts of the in-game currency. From the start you\\'ll need to do multiple runs just to reach the 3/10 upgrade for one stat like Hp/Attack and getting far enough in a run is extremely difficult because of the largely luck based difficulty per run. I say \"luck based\" because you really aren\\'t making it past the second boss without a unique or legendary skull and even then it needs to be very specific skulls, most of the rare or lower grade skulls are pretty awful so much so that youll end up dropping them without hesitation. Also the resource gain inside runs is too low, you either have to give up gaining a stat increasing item/ new skull for gold or run the risk of not being able to buy anything from the store/even heal since you need to pay for that too. Upgrading skulls during your runs doesn\\'t carry over between runs even though gaining the resources to upgrade are painfully difficult to get by sacrificing other skulls that you barely ever find to begin with. Overall the game feels kind of like an unpolished Dead Cells, I think overtime if the issues above are addressed this game could be great but right now it is bogged down by an unrewarding and slow progression system as well as no real way to improve your runs aside from small stat changes that you\\'d build up over multiple hours of gameplay just to see some slightly bigger numbers appear on your screen.',\n",

The amount of variance in builds while still being viable is genuinely impressive. The gameplay is fun and feels good. It's challenging without being completely and hopelessly impossible. This is one of my favorite platforming roguelikes.\\n\\nWith that being said, there is one extremely glaring issue that I absolutely cannot believe they didn't fix in the 1.0 release, and it's the only reason I can't recommend this game. There is no (And I do mean literally zero) way to tell what any of your stats, besides health, are at any given time. There are so many different things affecting your lil dude, and absolutely no way to see any of it. There are items and quintessences and Skuls and shrines and a skill tree and spells and blessings and buffs and boss debuffs and several other things going on, but literally no way to know exactly what your stats are at at any time (Do bosses even give debuffs? Idk man because I literally cannot see any stats at all). Should I trade out this item that gives spell damage for this item that gives attack speed? Idfk man, this is my 800th run and I didn't memorize every single little thing affecting me. It wouldn't matter so much if there weren't so many things affecting you at all times (Dead Cells is a good example of a game where stat tracking really isn't necessary). But for a game with such an intense obsession with telling you numbers and percentages and decimal points for everything, it's very very bizarre that they don't give you any way to see your own stats.\\n\\nWith that being said, they've laid out a quarterly roadmap for the game, and they've listed a stat interface as something they're implementing in Q4. My recommendation? Honestly? Don't get the game until then. When they put the stat interface in, I'll be pumping several hundred more hours into the game and I'll also be getting it for my Switch.

The game itself doesn't feel challenging or difficult in the same vein as other Roguelikes like Hades; just simply unfair. I've gotten past the first boss only two or three times now, and each of these times it has solely depended on if the game gave me a Legendary character that could drain the boss' health bar in 2-3 moves. Almost all of my woes with this game can be summarized by looking at how much RNG factors into a run; against the minibosses I can get by alright with whatever skull I have equipped, but that first boss is just a huge wall that can only be passed if I have a crushing offense. In any other case, I'm swatted like a fly and left to redo the run, only getting to keep the Dark Quartz collected (not the bone shards? That's a pain).\\n\\nTwo other complaints so far -- there are graphical errors when playing in Ultrawide (not a big pain, just some background flickering) and the aforementioned first boss constantly trips me up by having my character stutter when trying to attack while on its collarbone perch (a big reason why my runs fail so often -- trying to do combo attacks during an opening and simply can't do so thanks to the sprite stuttering back and forth).

The game's absurdly grindy due to the obscenely high costs of character upgrades, meaning very little progress is gained each actual game, even in games where you get an extremely good skull and make tons of progress. Add onto that that the game's soundtrack is extremely limited, which means you're typically listening to the same generic JRPG tunes constantly.\\n\\nThere's one room in the game you typically encounter after the first miniboss but before the first real boss where you need- specifically- a Balance skull in order to avoid taking damage due to low hanging ceiling spikes and tons of floor spikes. Power skulls can't cross the gap and Speed skulls dash *too high* to be able to clear the gaps without bumping the ceiling and taking damage. Balance skulls are fine, but ONLY balance skulls.

It was just throwing you into new areas with a different coat of paint, and the stages in said areas also we're clearly copy and pasted areas with nothing new or challenging about it after you go through them a few times. On top of the already repetitive gameplay, the soundtrack was way too over the top for what you were thrown against. The music for minibosses was the equivalent of a dramatic orchestra, and being in the first area had the music playing like it was the end of times. One final thing: the game was way too grindy. I'm used to roguelike characters being weak at the start, but the dash gave utterly no advantage as it stood and every good ability and advantage was locked behind an overly grindy requirement. Needless to say, everything in the game gave me an undesirable experience, with me trying my damned hardest for four hours to get enjoyment out of it for what it was.

Sanabi can't seem to decide whether it wants to be Katana Zero or The Messenger.\\n\\nThe gameplay suffers a similar identity crisis. The bionic arm feels really good, and checkpoints are distributed reasonably; still some sections run on with a single theme for far too long, and after spending twenty minutes on a one-hit-kill boss encounter where death meant starting completely over, I was too mentally exhausted to care about avenging my daughter.\\n\\nThe pixel animations and soundtrack are top-notch. Sanabi just needed a lot of trimming down elsewhere to be a compelling experience.\", \"Overrated. Looks good doesn't work. At first the game mechanics with the hook felt amazing, but not for long. It's either boring or annoying as hell. Levels are like 30 second before you get interrupted by the story. Of course you can skip it, if you want to. It's not the most creative story, but it is well done. It's just too long for what it is. For me games like this are more about the gameplay, but that doesn't mean I want to skip the story completely. And like I said. Gameplay could be great, if it was not for the boring level design, the constant breaks by dialogue and something feels off about the controls of the hook.\", \"I think it won't hurt to reiterate what is already present in almost all negative reviews of this game, namely the dialogues. I generally don't mind a substantial amount of text, however, in Sanabi, the dialogues are notably subpar and, oddly enough, longer than the gameplay itself. While I don't really like to make such comparisons, juxtaposing it with Katana ZERO - often associated with Sanabi - reveals significantly fewer dialogues, yet the same amount of information is conveyed. Furthermore, in Katana ZERO, you have the opportunity to actively engage in the story, with your decisions impacting plot details. Here, throughout the entire game, you have only one significant choice, and it's NOT a dialogue with a character. In other words, if I were to put it briefly, it feels like you're more of a spectator in a movie during the dialogue sections, where your participation is limited to repeatedly pressing the spacebar. It wasn't a significant issue, but considering the game's length, spending almost half of the total time on reading dialogues... let's be honest, that's at least not what you generally want and expect from such game, but this is already a more subjective opinion.\\n\\nOut of curiosity, during my second playthrough, I wondered how long it would take me to complete the first chapter without dialogues. The answer: around 20-30 minutes. How long does it actually take? Approximately one and a half to 2 hours. So, ponder that for a moment. \\n\\nMINOR SPOILERS ALERT:\\n[spoiler]If I were to consider the plot itself, it didn't capture my interest, even considering that it turned out to be different from what it seemed in the beginning, making it even worse.  In the insignificant details that eventually lead to something, there are quite noticeable inconsistencies that evoke puzzlement. However, attempting to connect them into a coherent whole would likely stump even the most seasoned detectives, making the plot unpredictably confusing. Upon reflection, the entire journey seems to have had absolutely no relevance to the conclusion - none whatsoever. The entire story unfolds literally in the last couple of minutes of the game.[/spoiler]\\n\\nThe one bright spot I'd genuinely tip my hat to is the gameplay. It turned out well, nevertheless was spoiled by the game's pace. Playing it the second time, already familiar with the game, was much more enjoyable than the first time. For me personally, the gameplay didn't seem particularly unique or exciting. I believe it could be due to the reasons mentioned earlier, and also that most features weren't thoroughly refined.\\n\\nWhat I would like to see more of are additional mechanics for speed of movement. Some momentum conservation or more thoughtful level design could enhance the experience. With such mechanics, the locations could've been much more diverse, opponents strategically placed rather than respawning, and the approaches to them could've been more inventive than simply circling a platform from below and sneaking up behind them.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I essentially got what I wanted, but there is a feeling that the developers didn't polish the game to perfection, and it has obvious flaws. Some, or maybe even many, decisions seem strange. This makes me doubt about the quality of the game that, at first glance, seemed good.\", \"Maybe Celeste spoiled me. Maybe Titanfall 2 spoiled me. But all the mechanics that go into the grappling hook feel off. The dash isn't very fun to use, and doesn't feel natural. The auto-teleport of the combat grapple is weird. Climbing is clunky, and worst of all, the grappling hook feels... static, for a lack of a better word. There's passion here, for sure, but it's hit just below the mark for me.\\nThe main appeal is the aesthetics, which it for nails. The graphics are beautiful and the story, while a bit tired, is still enjoyable, for the short amount of time that I played. But besides that, I can't really recommend it.\", 'This game is pretty fun and fluid when it lets you play, but ruined by poor pacing. Gameplay is frequently interrupted by slow-walking story sections that take an interesting concept and spread it out over too many minutes of moody music and silence.\\n\\nThis game would be fixed by tightening up these sections - improving run speed foremost, but also editing dialog for brevity and improving English localization. The farther I got into the game, the more frustrating these story breaks became. There were also two separate tutorial levels, without much actual gameplay between them. Why? Unsure - maybe another artifact of build-it-as-we-go early access. \\n\\nI wish the developers well - this could be a gem, but it isn’t one yet.', 'Clearly these guys wanted to make a movie or an anime or smthn. Instead we got a tapping A simulator with some platforming here and there.\\n     Okay, the pixel art is PERFECT. As for the gameplay it is pretty fun. The movement feels good and tight and the grappling hook is really fun to use. BUT the gameplay is really the 20% of the game! the other 80% is tapping A on the dialogs which sometimes are unskippable. \\n  There is clearly something there and the potential was big but the game is really repetitive and it drags on for too long making me lose all interest in the story. \\n', 'The storytelling here is proof you need more literary experience than anime and manga to write a coherent narrative and convincing characters. \"Wacky and cute\" mixed with memes is not a substitute for good writing.\\n\\nIt\\'s as if the storyboard was written by a child who grew up spending more time in parasocial relationships and discord chats than in person with other people. This is increasingly common now, isn\\'t it?\\n\\nAs for gameplay, it\\'s fun yet disappointingly simple. The challenge does evolve enough to not become boring but it does feel like the levels drag on at times. It hooks you with a fun mechanic then leaves you hanging by not doing much clever with it.', 'I didn\\'t feel enough in control of my character given how fast paced the game tried to be. Shift skill was shit, crawling on ceiling made you jump after reaching the end of ceiling for some reason. Cooldown on hook sometimes fucked you up when the targeting fucked you up. I enjoy fast and challenging games. Dying in a game when challenged isn\\'t usually frustrating. In this game it felt very often very frustrating. \\n\\nGraphics were great, sound design ok-ish, sountrack not to my liking at all. Story ok, but not particularly strong. \\n\\nGameplay just didn\\'t feel good enough.\\n\\n7/10, not recommending to nudge the \"overwhelmingly positive\" down for my part.', \"I wish I could recommend this game, however after about 90 minutes of play I had to request a refund. Here are the issues I had that were enough for me to not want to finish playing:\\n\\n      - The core game play loop is not especially fun. I think speedrunners will love this game, but for more casual players it feels somewhat monotonous and uninteresting.\\n      - Combat lacks depth\\n      - Comparisons to Katana Zero are aesthetic and people should not expect a similar gameplay experience\\n      - The story is mediocre at best if not downright cliche, and there are far too many cut scenes. The grizzled old veteran protagonist and central conflict of the narrative is incredibly tiresome and overdone. Maybe there's some big twist later in the game, but it simply becomes an absolute slog from the get-go. \\n\\nHonestly, it was the dialogue and story that made me stop altogether, and the undue time this is given in comparison to a somewhat stilted core gameplay loop. Maybe some future updates will improve the gameplay, but I cannot recommend this one.\", 'a fun game ruined by the story element. you can be having fun swinging for a couple minutes then have to sit through a dialogue dump. rinse repeat. I was about done with it and then I finally met elon musk and I had to put it down.', 'Great pixel graphics.\\n\\nWay too much dialogue for a subpar story.\\nLess than ideal controls for dashing.', \"[h1] Off-brand Katana ZERO [/h1]\\n\\nI saw when the Katana ZERO developer was gonna play a lot of different games akin to his own on stream, as to push more publicity. I had never heard of it, so when I saw it was going to be one of the games showcased I wanted to check it out beforehand.\\n...I'm very disappointed.\\n\\n\\n\\n[h1] Story [/h1]\\n\\nI don't care about the story nor the characters; so when there's like a fricking 1,5 hour elongated never-ending exposition dump of every single character ever in the intro, then that's just a HUGE turn-off. I'm not given reason to like any of the characters, and I prematurely already don't care for them due to the sour taste in my mouth from its horrible pacing & storytelling; so at such point why should I? The only reason I should ever care about any of these characters is because my main-character would, but he doesn't even do that very much. He shrugs most characters off or don't care about them. ??????????\\nIt's like God of War 2018 Kratos all-over again, but at least here it didn't ruin a previously good character.\\nAnd the cutscenes are WAYYYYYYYYYYY TOOOOOOOOO LOONG and WAYYYYY TOO MANY OF THEM. I swear it feels like 90% of my game time are just cutscenes or dialogue. I only learnt about the ability to skip cutscenes like half-way through. OK. But then you skip the cutscene, which then leads you into another cutscene, which leads you into the next cutscene, which then leads you into a new cutscene; which you can't skip for some reason??? And then you're loaded into even further dialogue for some reason, and then even more........... This is unacceptable.\\n\\n\\n\\n[h1] Game-play [/h1]\\n\\nThe tutorial for this game goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on. I can't believe I've only played this game for 4 hours, as the tutorial alone felt like 16 hours in total. It was abhorrent! Not a fan.\\nYou can't just give like 80 rooms or whatever just meant to tutor you in a row with bare-minimum pace shifts. It's just parkour, parkour, parkour, parkour, parkour, parkour, parkour... The combat alone only gets introduced like an hour in........... WHAT?! HOW?! This is embarrassing. I just don't understand whatsoever.\\nAnd even the combat feels broken. It's so easy, and yet so mushy. Playing on 'Hard' was actually embarrassing.\\nThe entire combat system is just bad in execution. The slingshot grapple-hook arm is so wimpy, and I feel like I weigh as much as a feather, as I have no control of my movement if I'm hanging still. I can't rock myself back 'n' forth anymore, and when I do have momentum it feels really awkward. When I loosen my grip on platforms there goes a small second before my character actually does it, it's weird. It completely ruins my precision & timing.\\nAnd when I'm a fast-paced, complex character that can fly all-over the room then ultimately why are my enemies robots that are locked still & unable to move? They pose no threat. It's like a battle between One Punch Man & a pebble; where's the excitement??\\n\\n\\n\\n[h1] Visuals [/h1]\\n\\nThe sprite work is somewhere between 'good' & 'awful'. There are times where the game looks good, I won't deny that. However it is immensely dumbed down by the sheer amount of times it does not. A lot of the times the background is extremely flat, stale, boring, empty, and lifeless.\\nThe art-style is really inconsistent. There are times where background/foreground items have a black outline, there are times when they don't. There are times when the animations are smooth, there are times when they aren't. There are times when the game is really bright, there are times where it's too dark. There are times where the game is too barren looking, there are times it's too flooded with busy details.\\nIt feels like 700 different people with truly unique & different art-styles & visions tried to work on the game, and all with poor management & quality control.\\nIt feels like the game wants to look like 60 different games at the same time.\\nAnd I swear to god some of the animations are frame by frame copied straight from Katana ZERO.\\n\\n\\n\\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\\n\\nI'm shocked, I didn't know it could be this bad.\\nIt feels like it was made by fan of Katana ZERO & Celeste; but completely misunderstood or never even comprehended what made either of those aforementioned games 'good' or 'fun'. The inspirations are hefty.\\nI'm completely staggered by how bad this all is.\\n\\nI like some of the music though.\", \"Remember the grappling hook from Worms? They made a game around that.   As of Oct 2022, it's unfinished, not that hard,  and not that rewarding. The story is kinda gibberish and the pacing is really slow.  It's no Katana Zero, yet.\", '(review 16 months after EA release)\\n\\nClunky controls with mouse + keyboard, even worse with controller. \\n\\nThe platforming feels bad compared to other indie platformers with similar mechanics or inspirations (Webbed, Katana Zero, Will You Snail) and especially bad compared to the best of the bunch (Celeste, Super Meat Boy).\\n\\nWay too many long slow walking story segments with poor writing that can only be skipped in their entirety, missing the story, with no log to read or a way to speed up the individual messages.\\n\\nThe pixel art is great. The story could be good if rewritten and tightened up.\\n', \"Hate to give this a thumbs down because the price was low and it had its moments. But can't give a thumbs up to game with as much slow walk & talk as any AAA garbage out there.  And the gameplay was mid. Story decent though.\\n\", 'I don\\'t know. It\\'s not terrible and there are some good ideas here. But I\\'m about four hours in and in the middle of an extended \"run through this room before a timed thing kills you\" and it\\'s been a real momentum sucker. Terrible checkpoints mean that I have to redo multiple sections over and over, and I sometimes die through no fault of my own (I use the hook, the game chooses for it not to stick to a surface for no determinable reason).\\n\\nAnd the story is just horrendously bad. Sad dad\\'s kid dies and sad dad meets another kid whose dad has died. They bond. Robots. And that\\'s all wrapped around incredibly extraneous dialog that goes on forever and ever, hitting every trope you could possibly imagine while engaging in trite tricks to obfuscate what\\'s really going on for as long as possible.\\n\\nI might jump back into it? But this brick wall is really frustrating. I don\\'t have a lot of time to play games, wasting an hour on the same stupid challenge over and over again just is not fun. At all.', \"This game is fun overall but it has a few issues that kind of ruin it for me. This game, to put it simply, plays like a browser game. It feels rushed, and there's a lot of things not well thought out. For such a fun combat system the enemies don't flow together (instead of spawning waves in one room perhaps just make bigger rooms with more enemies?) comboing from one enemy to the other is fun, and the pause for spawn really throws that off. The game feels a little rushed, with rooms feeling similar to one another, even identical. The art is great, but sometimes I think that I accidentally got turned around while playing. For a game so focused on the story (extremely long cutscenes, which feel like they take up more of the game then gameplay) it feels empty and the characters often make me cringe. The games got some great bones, but the meat of this game is what prompted me to write this review. I wouldn't recommend buying this game unless the price gets lowered to less then ten dollars, probably closer to 5 dollars.\", 'STORY-----\\n\\nI understand that for average people who aren\\'t analytical and do not care about the nuances in storytelling, the story is good. But as someone who does and as someone who writes stories myself, I was gravely disappointed. To open this review, the story starts MASTERFULLY, advertising itself as a revenge story where you are a retired veteran avenging the death of your daughter, and going after this elusive \"sanabi\" That serves as kind of the mystery/investigatory part of the game. However the game quickly takes focus from the actual revenge story, and forces this obnoxious relationship between the protagonist and this annoying child Mari. Mari would not be insufferable if it weren\\'t for the writing. The dialogue sections take 20 minutes to explain something that can be gone over in 5 minutes. The general flow of the game in the beginning is that you have a 20 minute cutscene, followed by 10 minutes of gameplay, which I would\\'ve been fine with if the game had focused on the plot that was brought up in the opening, instead of just focusing on this little girl I don\\'t care about (Because she is not written well, it feels as if the developers want desperately for you to like her, and you can feel the desperation in the cutscenes) After like 8 hours of this, you finally get into what sanabi actually is.\\n\\nSo this is just a personal piece of advice from me. Not every story need an insane plot twist ESPECIALLY this one. When it has to do with characters you get to know and love, plot twists can be done well, but they can be also done very poorly.\\nToward the end of the game, some of your comrades show up and start arbitrarily fighting you, and you learn that you are in fact, NOT the protagonist the game literally set you up as, but you are a combat bot with implanted memories of your daughter. Which this could have been fine if it wasn\\'t done in the most obnoxious cliche way possible. \\nThis game is like a toxic high school girlfriend who gives you just enough to keep coming back, then ghosts you,\\nit is very very frustrating to play, and not in a good way. I have a special place od hatred in my heart, for stories that pretentiously lead you on a wild goose chase, then proceed to explain nothing and a conceivable way, it is frustrating and manipulative. You can have a convoluted plot and make it interesting, but Sanabi\\'s plot isn\\'t even convoluted, it\\'s just god awful, it almost seems like this game was playtested/peer reviewed very little.\\n\\nGAMEPLAY------\\nThe gameplay could have been good, but just like the story it teases you with very cool segments that I personally enjoyed, before throwing you into one of the most tedious segments you\\'ve ever played. The hook arm does not feel natural, I can\\'t pinpoint why, but it always feels as if it is working against you. Getting momentum is a pain in the ass, you get his when you shouldn\\'t. for some reason when releasing your hook, the protagonist automatically jumps, which is fucking stupid, because theres been times where ive released, and my guy just jumps into a red box and hurts me on his own.\\n\\nThe enemies are alright, but I never felt as if I was fighting them per say, more like i was just using them to platform around. There are some interesting mechanics with the hook and different types of enemies introduced later, but the interest is squandered, because the game finds a way to make them as tedious as possible.\\n\\nThere is a difference between fun difficulty, and absolute tedium. I\\'ve played all the \"tedious\" games. Loves both hotline miamis and have beaten them multiple times, loved katana zero. However this game is tedious in a very frusturating way. When you take damage it almost never feels justified, due to your hook which seems to almost never do what you want it to. Enemies sometimes fire at you in a way that can stunlock you and kill you no matter what you do, and the biggest offender: WHY IS THERE A MORE THAN 5 SECOND BLACK SCREEN AFTER YOU DIE? Seriously! It takes fucking forever to respawn, just so you can enter into a level that you do not know the layout of, and die because of the shit controls.\\n\\nI know what you\\'re thinking, I\\'m not mad cuz bad lol. I\\'ve played lots of games that have the same mechanics, Hotline Miami and katana zero have harsher, 1 hit kill mechanics, so in theory, this game, which has a 4 hit kill mechanic, SHOULD be more bearable. It\\'s not. Making a game that is similar to those two, DOES NOT WORK when you try to change up the way hit points work. The health system is so arbitrary, and almost seems like it exists as an excuse to make bosses 3 fucking hours long.\\n\\nThe Bosses are a real issue for me.\\nThe first fight in the game is with this guy with a gun for a head. I have to say this is my favorite scene in the whole game.\\nIt was a short fight, and it was fun and exciting.\\n\\nBosses later in the game are these excruciatingly long tedious fights, where you rarely ever feel in control of your circumstances.\\n\\nThere was a fight toward the end with a helicopter, where I had to hook onto these bombs and slingshot them at the helicopter to destroy it. I was thinking \"Yeah I probably have to shoot 3 or 4 bombs at it\" NOPE. 12 fucking bombs.\\n\\n12 bombs later, and 15 deaths later, half of which probably due to an unfair circumstance, and the fight is over.\\nThis game constantly does this where it will introduce something so cool, then just squander it, and it is very emotionally frustrating. The helicopter fight doesn\\'t become badass or exhilarating anymore, when I the actual fight takes 15 minutes to do (not including deaths), and starts you from the beginning of the entire fight every time you die, (usually to something beyond your control).\\n\\nSanabi is a game that I was fucking stoked for, and I was HOOKED from the beginning, however from that point on, it systematically squanders every single thing I was hoping for it to be. So you may disagree with that, but it\\'s just my take on things, and I do not recommend the game. I personally feel that I have wasted my time.\\n\\nGo play Katana Zero if you haven\\'t.', \"They should have taken the cue from the much better katana zero and not overdo the cutscenes... like 5 minutes of gameplay at a time and then walls of dialogue for a tropey story that isn't very good\", 'I have 30 minutes logged in this game before I decided to refund. I got to actually play for maybe 2 or 3 of those minutes. The rest is just overly long exposition or needless slowing down of the character for effect.\\n\\nGameplay is fun, sadly it takes a distant backseat to a hamfisted C-Tier story. I’ve had more fun watching unskippable ads on YouTube.', 'Sinabi looks like Katana Zero with a grappling hook. This game had so much promise, but the cons overshadow the gameplay. I only got about 40% of the way through the game so perhaps it gets better, but from what I played it was a 5.0/10 experience. \\n\\nPros: The core concept is good. Base mechanics feel good. Climbing and jumping feel good. The art and animations are pretty. The story is somewhat interesting. \\n\\nCons: The way the game builds on the core gameplay is uninspired and boring. The additional upgrades to the grappling hook all amount to slightly different movement tech. The level design is samey with square walls and square floors. The background art is so pretty but the actual level art is just rectangles. The combat and boss fights are just copy pasted with slight changes. All you do is swing around platforms and hook onto enemies. The worst con of them all is the way the story is presented in this game. About 30-40% of this game is just text and really slow cutscenes. I can\\'t tell you how many times I\\'ve verbally said out loud \"PLEASE JUST LET ME PLAY THE GAME\". Need to press a button on a wall? Time to watch a cutscene of your character slowly walking to the button and pressing it. There are so many just nonsense animscenes that don\\'t really need to be there. You will get in the habit of skipping cutscenes in this game.', \"Understand what this game is. It's not a story-heavy game (it is that) with some light hookshot action, it's very technical hookshot work with a strong narrative, and unfortunately, I don't find that fun. Simple hookshot stuff is fine, but I don't like it when it gets too complex.\", \"This was fun up until the stealth section. It wouldn't be that hard to power through, but the story wasn't engaging enough to give me a reason to.\", '[h1] \"We have Katana ZERO at home\" [/h1]\\n\\nWell, SANABI is more like a mix of Katana ZERO and Celeste, but not nearly as good as either. It\\'s not terrible, and this would be a \"thumbs sideways\" if Steam had such a thing. The concept and core mechanics are solid, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired.\\n\\nThe main grapple hook mechanic takes a bit of getting used to, but once you have a feel for it zipping around feels pretty good. Your suite of tools gives you enough options from the start to make things interesting, and the upgrades you unlock open up new possibilities. Unfortunately, the mechanics are let down by mediocre level design and bad pacing. Levels introduce new ideas like moving platforms or danger zones but fail to evolve these in interesting ways and quickly become repetitive and stale. \\n\\nThat, is when you even get to play at all. SANABI constantly pulls you out of the action for cutscenes, many of which are inane and unnecessary, and this choppiness makes the whole experience drag and prevents you from getting into a flow. Another annoyance is that when you die or fall into a pit, it takes a few seconds before you respawn. A big part of the reason dying a few dozen times in a challenging platforming sequence in Celeste doesn\\'t feel so bad is that it gets you back into the action instantly. SANABI is nowhere near as difficult as Celeste, but on the occasional challenging segment where you do die or fall a few times in a row, the slow respawn adds unnecessary frustration.\\n\\nSpending so much time in cutscenes also makes you realize how bad SANABI\\'s writing is. The story concept is interesting, if unlikely to surprise you. But the narrative is disjointed, with frequent references to characters, lore, and worldbuilding that are never explained and a plot that spends an inordinate amount of time chasing its tail. The dialogue in particular is rough. It sounds nothing like how people actually talk, and half the time SANABI can\\'t seem to decide if it wants to be a thriller or a comedy. Though it\\'s hard to say how much of the dialogue issues are due to bad writing versus how much should be attributed to a translation that was clearly written by someone whose English skills weren\\'t up to the task.\\n\\nThe art and music are the strongest components of SANABI. It\\'s obvious the creators were heavily inspired by Katana ZERO, but insofar as SANABI is an imitation in this regard it\\'s a very good one. The pixel art looks great throughout, with detailed and imaginative environments, and the music has good energy. It\\'s exactly the backing you want for flying around on a grapple hook smashing robots.\\n\\nI liked SANABI just enough to finish it, and it might be worth picking up on sale if you like these types of games. But if you\\'re expecting the next Katana ZERO, lower your expectations. A lot.', 'There is absolutely nothing special about this game. At some point I felt it was made by AI.\\n\\nGameplay gets fun only closer to the end.\\n\\nStory is childish and lame, I cried.', 'I think if this game was revisited it could seriously be a WAY killer game, but right now I am not liking a lot of what I just experienced playing this.\\n\\nThe mechanics were really awful to the point that it put me off from the entire game\\'s story (especially the shift lock-on, the entire factory section, immunity enemies and the general mechanic of just pushing shit, the waiting 50 yrs to retry after falling/dying, constant flow interruptions).\\n\\nThe game\\'s story is also presented in a really annoying way where there is so much exposition dumping and 4356893689535 flashbacks in between gameplay that it ends up being more like a 70/30 cutscene/gameplay ordeal, and the storytelling structure that was went with was so much \"tell dont show\" that everything it was going for felt like it hit way less than it would\\'ve if it just let the game speak for itself instead of trying to invest so hard on the \"plot twist\" moment that ends up just being another exposition dump while doing some really basic platforming in contrast to if the game just let it speak for itself.\\n\\nALSO WHY IS THE MOST BORING PART OF THE STORY THE MAJORITY OF THE GAME??? The plot twist and onward were way more interesting topics and ideas that could have been touched on, but instead they amass for like 25% of the game only or something??? The dialogue earlier in the game is also so bad (which is on purpose, but it doesn\\'t really excuse it personally)\\n\\nI could not emotionally tune myself in to the ending because of how exhausting it was to sit through the game. If even playtesting was more rigorously done, I think even just that would at least had let me enjoy the ending more. Otherwise I was just like yea wow that\\'s definitely the ending I expected.\\n\\nTo me this game would have done much better if there was actually way more playtesting that was done before rollout, and if the general storytelling structure of the game was handled in a WAY different manner that didn\\'t rely so much on cutting between the gameplay, and constantly spamming flashbacks and exposition dumps on your face\\n\\nIdk that\\'s mainly the impression and issues I got from this game, and they are so tremendous that I can\\'t consider this game good, or something that should be recommended.', 'I don\\'t really like this game. The story at first is really cute and then kinda heavy and interesting but it\\'s also mostly very forced. The gameplay is \"fast paced\" but the story parts keep bringing the character to a halt and forcing you in a slow walk state, which breaks the flow of the game.\\n\\nOf course the artstyle and visuals are really good, but some things get reused in the worst possible way. Can\\'t really describe it without getting into very early spoilers but the character interactions and personalities are reused between multiple characters and kinda removes some of the impact of what happened to the earlier character.\\n\\nAs for the gameplay, it feels \"wrong\". At first you see the chain arm thing launch a claw with a satisfying sound and mechanical noise, expecting it to behave like a grappling hook. But nope, it becomes completely flaccid and acts like a swinging rope. Then the game teaches you that you can attach the arm chain to enemies and reel onto them, using the chain like what you would expect of a grappling hook from other games. So now you have this weird mix of two completely different behaviors depending on what the chain arm attaches onto and it\\'s very jarring and disorienting. It makes it feel like you have little to no control over the character\\'s movement. On top of that the chain arm has a weird auto aiming that isn\\'t always aiming where you would expect so you have to correct for it, making it feel like you have to fight the controls.\\n\\nTalking of controls, at first I tried playing the game with my 8bitdo controller that is supposed to be recognised like an xbox controller, but no, the game didnt even understand there was a controller connected. Then I tried using the steam input thing to map keyboard and mouse to controller, but it made the chain arm aiming completely useless. So I tried playing with keyboard and mouse instead but it wasn\\'t really nice either.\\n\\nAlso back to gameplay, the momentum feels wrong. Depending on which direction I was pressing, sometimes the character would come to a complete stop after releasing from a super fast swing, but sometimes he would be launched into the expected trajectory. Gravity and momentum feel like they have no effect on the swing behavior, even tho it\\'s supposed to be the main thing the player does. Sometimes when holding no directions the swinging worked fine in an expected manner but then pressing a key would break that natural movement. It\\'s hard to explain but it just plainly felt wrong.']\n"
